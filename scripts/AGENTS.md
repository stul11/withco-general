# Agent Guidelines

## Terminal Command Safety

Follow the validated terminal safety rules when providing commands. Run only one logical command per tool call, avoid chaining with `&&`, `;`, or pipes for control flow, and never include newlines inside a command string. For multi-step work, write a script to disk, mark it executable, then run it. Use `is_background: true` for long-running tasks.
