**Date**: 2025-01-27T17:30:00Z  
**Agent**: Background Agent  
**Owner**: System  
**Task ID**: Pre-commit validation for agent-offboarding staging area

## Inputs & Context

- TODO item from SN_20251002_session-note-template-analysis.md
- Request to run `pre-commit run --all-files` for agent-offboarding staging area
- Pre-commit configuration in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

## Full Findings

**Pre-commit Check Results**: ✅ **ALL HOOKS PASSED**

### Pre-commit Configuration Analysis

The repository has a well-configured pre-commit setup with three hooks:

1. **markdown-link-check** - Validates markdown links using `scripts/check_markdown_links.py`
2. **validate-iso-timestamps** - Validates ISO 8601 timestamps in docs using `scripts/validate_iso_timestamps.py`
3. **sync-agents-rules** - Synchronizes agent rules using `scripts/sync_agents_rules.py --check`

### Installation Process

- Successfully installed pre-commit 4.3.0 via pip
- Added `~/.local/bin` to PATH to access pre-commit binary
- All hooks executed successfully without errors

2. **Pre-commit Execution**
   - Added pre-commit binary to PATH
   - Executed `pre-commit run --all-files`
   - All three hooks passed successfully
