# Collect Cost of Manufacturing an Offering Inputs

## Problem

- **User**: Legal team, finance team, and offering design stakeholders
- **Core pain point**: Lack of comprehensive data on cost structures for manufacturing offerings, particularly for UPREIT and LLC structures
- **Key risks**: Inaccurate pricing, regulatory compliance issues, competitive disadvantage
- **Why now?**: Need to establish baseline cost understanding before designing new offerings

## Solution

- **Goal**: Comprehensive database of cost inputs for manufacturing offerings across different structures and jurisdictions
- **Assumptions & inputs**:
  - Public data sources are sufficient for initial research
  - Cost structures vary significantly by jurisdiction and structure type
  - Minimum check sizes impact cost structures
- **Explicitly out of scope**:
  - Actual offering design and implementation
  - Legal analysis of specific structures
  - Final pricing decisions
- **Solution outline**:
  - Research and document cost patterns across jurisdictions
  - Create standardized vendor list and cost data
  - Establish framework for ongoing cost tracking

## Context & Background

### Current State

- Limited understanding of cost structures for manufacturing offerings
- No standardized approach to cost data collection
- RSM call notes provide initial context but need systematic organization
- Existing spreadsheet with some vendor data needs expansion

### Research Scope

- **UPREIT structures**: Cost patterns and minimum check requirements
- **LLC structures**: Formation and maintenance costs
- **Jurisdictional variations**: State-by-state cost differences
- **Vendor standardization**: Consistent vendor list and pricing

### Related Work

- LEG-9: Determine Minimum Check Size (related research)
- RSM call notes: Initial context and insights
- Economics cost structure research: Background context

## Success Metrics

- **Data Completeness**: 80%+ coverage of major jurisdictions and structure types
- **Standardization**: Consistent vendor list and cost categorization
- **Usability**: Clear framework for ongoing cost tracking
- **Accuracy**: Validated cost data from reliable sources

## Dependencies

- **Upstream**: RSM call notes completion (DONE)
- **Parallel**: LEG-9 minimum check size research
- **Downstream**: Offering design and pricing decisions

## Implementation Considerations

### Research Approach

- **Primary sources**: State regulatory filings, industry reports
- **Secondary sources**: Vendor websites, industry publications
- **Validation**: Cross-reference multiple sources for accuracy

### Data Organization

- **Standardized vendor list**: Consistent categorization and contact info
- **Cost data structure**: Organized by jurisdiction, structure type, cost category
- **Update mechanism**: Process for maintaining current data

### Resource Requirements

- **Time**: 2-3 days for comprehensive research
- **Tools**: Spreadsheet for data organization, research databases
- **Expertise**: Legal and finance team input for validation

## Open Questions

1. **Scope depth**: How detailed should cost breakdowns be?
2. **Update frequency**: How often should cost data be refreshed?
3. **Validation process**: What level of validation is needed for cost data?
4. **Integration**: How should this integrate with existing cost models?

## Next Steps

1. **Research Setup**: Create research framework and data structure
2. **Data Collection**: Gather cost data from multiple sources
3. **Validation**: Cross-reference and validate collected data
4. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive cost database
5. **Framework**: Establish ongoing cost tracking process
