# Session Note

- **Task ID**: implement-todos-and-reference-session-note
- **Agent**: Background Agent
- **Owner**: slittle
- **Date**: 2025-10-02T06:30:00Z
- **Duration**: ~15 minutes

## Inputs & Context

- TODO_Log.md items 151-152: High priority tasks to resolve broken links and verify navigation
- SN_20251002_session-note-template-analysis.md: Analysis of session note template consistency issues
- Agent-offboarding handoff documentation identifying specific broken links
- Repository link checker and validation scripts

## Full Findings

**Link Status**: All markdown links are currently valid (confirmed by `python3 scripts/check_markdown_links.py`)

**Navigation Verification**: Cross-references between `.cursor/rules/*` and `docs/agents/workflows/*` are properly established:

- `.cursor/rules/agent-chat-commands.mdc` → `docs/agents/workflows/Background_Agent_Draft_Review_Workflow.md` ✅
- `docs/agents/workflows/Background_Agent_Draft_Review_Workflow.md` → Multiple `.cursor/rules/*` files ✅
- All referenced rule files exist and are accessible ✅

**Session Note Analysis Reference**: The analysis in SN_20251002_session-note-template-analysis.md identified critical inconsistencies in session note requirements, but the specific broken links mentioned in the TODO items were already resolved in previous sessions.

## Steps Taken

1. **Link Verification**: Ran `python3 scripts/check_markdown_links.py` - result: "All markdown links OK"
2. **Navigation Path Analysis**: Verified cross-references between rules and workflows directories
3. **File Existence Check**: Confirmed all referenced files exist and are accessible
4. **TODO Status Update**: Marked both high-priority TODO items as completed

## Outputs

- **Files Modified**: None (links were already resolved)
- **Validation Results**: All markdown links pass validation
- **Navigation Status**: All cross-references between rules and workflows are functional
- **TODO Updates**: Marked items 151-152 as completed in TODO_Log.md

## Citations

- `docs/global/TODO_Log.md:L151-L152` - Original TODO items
- `docs/agents/session-notes/SN_20251002_session-note-template-analysis.md` - Referenced analysis
- `scripts/check_markdown_links.py` - Link validation script
- `.cursor/rules/agent-chat-commands.mdc:L12` - Rules to workflows reference
- `docs/agents/workflows/Background_Agent_Draft_Review_Workflow.md:L502-L527` - Workflow to rules references

## Risks & Issues Identified

- **No Current Issues**: All links are valid and navigation paths are functional
- **Historical Context**: Previous sessions had already resolved the broken links mentioned in the handoff
- **Pre-commit Status**: Pre-commit hooks are configured but not installed in current environment

## Reasoning & Rationale

The TODO items referenced broken links that were already resolved in previous agent sessions. The verification process confirmed that:

1. **Link Checker Results**: All markdown links pass validation
2. **Navigation Integrity**: Cross-references between rules and workflows are properly maintained
3. **File Accessibility**: All referenced files exist and are accessible

The session note template analysis provided valuable context about consistency issues, but the specific broken links mentioned in the TODO items were not present in the current repository state.

## Next Actions

- **Immediate**: None - tasks completed successfully
- **Follow-up**: Consider implementing the session note enhancement proposals from the analysis
- **Monitoring**: Continue to validate links during future sessions

## Signoff

- **Reviewer**: slittle
- **Status**: completed
- **Date**: 2025-10-02T06:30:00Z
- **Notes**: All broken links were already resolved; navigation verification completed successfully
