Start a bestâ€‘practices ticket draft with minimal input.

## Usage

/ticket-new "Title"
```

## Behavior

- Prompts for missing essentials (team, due date, DoD target)
- Operates in chat only; does not write files without confirmation
- Seeds `GLB-TKT_Best_Practices.md` structure in the working draft
