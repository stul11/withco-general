## Objective

Research how retail investment platforms implement two-tiered minimum check structures, specifically focusing on how they differentiate between existing vs. new investors and what criteria they use.

### 3. Minimum Check Tiers

- What are typical minimum check sizes for each tier?
- How do minimums vary by offering type (Reg A+, Reg D, etc.)?
- What factors influence minimum check sizing?
- How do platforms communicate tier differences to investors?

### 4. Implementation Patterns

- How are tiers enforced technically?
- What documentation is required for tier verification?
- How do platforms handle investor onboarding for different tiers?
- What compliance considerations exist?

### 5. Business Rationale

- Why do platforms use two-tiered structures?
- What benefits do they provide?
- How do they impact platform economics?
- What are the trade-offs?
