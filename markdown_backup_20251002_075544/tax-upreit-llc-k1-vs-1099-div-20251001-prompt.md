You are ChatGPT 5.0 Pro. Act as a meticulous U.S. tax research assistant and Excel-savvy analyst. Your job is to (1) research and (2) deliver a complete, source-backed, _Excel-ready_ package explaining—in extreme detail—how tax form preparation works for two investor situations:

A) **K‑1 Property LLC** (investor receives a Schedule K‑1 from a real-estate partnership/LLC filing Form 1065), and  
B) **UPREIT with investors receiving 1099‑DIV** (assume investor holds REIT common shares that issue a 1099‑DIV; other separate investors hold OP units that issue a K‑1).

### What I need (high-level)

1. A deep explanation of forms, schedules, and filing workflows for both scenarios, including all triggers that add complexity.
2. A complete TurboTax support + pricing map for these scenarios (by tier and by form).
3. A cost model for **software** (TurboTax Online, by tier and by state add-ons), with _incremental_ costs when the investor already files a K‑1 or adds states/properties.
4. A comprehensive set of TSV (tab-delimited) calculators and matrices that I can paste into Excel at **cell A1** and have the formulas work immediately.
5. Exhaustive, _official_ links to IRS forms and instructions (and other authoritative sources) for every assertion.

## Scope & assumptions (apply unless you explicitly override with sources)

- Jurisdiction: U.S. federal and state personal income tax for an individual investor (Form 1040 filer).
- Tax years: prioritize the **most current filing season** available at the time you run this (likely 2024/2025 forms used for returns filed in 2025–2026). If a form or rule changed recently, call it out and date it.
- Investor profile: individual, not a C‑corp; not a tax professional. If a rule differs for married filing jointly vs single, note it.
- Be precise about when **Schedule B**, **Schedule D**, **Form 8949**, **Form 8995/8995‑A** (199A), **Form 1116** (foreign tax), **Form 4952** (investment interest), **Form 8582** (passive activity loss limitations), **Form 461** (excess business loss), **Form 6251** (AMT), **Form 4797/1231**, **Form 6252** (installment sale), **Schedule E**, **Schedule K‑3**, and any state nonresident returns are triggered.
- For REIT 1099‑DIV, break down **Boxes 1a/1b, 2a–2d, 3, 5 (199A dividends), 7 (foreign tax)**, how each flows onto returns/schedules, and when **Schedule D/8949** is required.
- For UPREIT specifics, explain the investor experiences that create both a K‑1 and a 1099‑DIV (e.g., holding OP units _and_ REIT shares, taxable exchanges, sales).
- For “profit interests,” **promote/carry** (splits above a pref) and **phantom equity**:
  - Distinguish LP investor vs GP/service provider scenarios.
  - Explain when these change the **forms** required (e.g., §1061 carried interest recharacterization -> Schedule D/Form 8949 reporting; service income potentially -> W‑2/1099‑NEC/1099‑MISC rather than 1099‑DIV).
  - Clarify if/when they affect REIT shareholders receiving **preferred dividends** (e.g., 199A treatment, capital gain distributions, return of capital, unrecaptured §1250, collectibles 28% category, foreign tax credit).
- State filings:
  - When does a **nonresident** state return get triggered by a K‑1 from property in another state?
  - What are the common **incremental** time/cost drivers: more K‑1s, more states, same sponsor multiple properties in one state, composite/withholding statements, PTET impacts (only as needed for investor-level filing).
- **Important**: Provide only **software** costs (TurboTax tiers & add‑ons). Provide _incremental_ costs for “already filing a K‑1” vs “adding another K‑1,” adding Schedule B or D, and adding states.

## Research & sourcing requirements

- **Browse the web** and cite _official_ IRS form pages and instructions for every form/schedule you reference. Include direct URLs.
- For **TurboTax**:
  - Document which _minimal_ TurboTax **Online** tier supports each form/schedule (e.g., K‑1 requires Premier+; Schedule D/8949 needs at least Premier, etc.).
  - Capture **current list pricing** for each tier, **state** pricing, and **e‑file** fees where applicable. Note any relevant details about state add-ons. Include links to official TurboTax pages. Capture the **date accessed**.
- For **professional preparation costs**:
  - Use **AICPA**, **NATP**, and other reputable surveys or firm fee schedules for price ranges _per schedule/form_ (e.g., add‑on for Schedule D or per K‑1). If necessary, include several representative sources and show ranges and medians.
- Every claim or price must have a **source link** and **accessed date**. If something varies widely by provider/state, say so and show the range.

## Deliverables (produce **only** the files listed below, each in its own fenced code block; no extra prose outside files)

**Important formatting rules for TSV:**

- Use **literal TAB characters** between columns (not spaces, not `\t`).

- For each calculator TSV, place:
  - An **INPUTS** block starting at **A1** with two columns: `Name<TAB>Value`.
  - A **CALCULATIONS** block starting at **A20** with a header row, and formulas that use **absolute cell references** to the INPUTS (e.g., `$B$2`). Provide at least one _worked example_ row using sample inputs.
- In Markdown files, include clear headings, short paragraphs, and bullet lists.

      - Do I need a nonresident state return?
      - Do profit interests/promote/phantom equity change my forms?

12. **`11_WORKED_EXAMPLES.md`**

    - At least **four** end‑to‑end examples:
      1. Single K‑1, one state, no sale.
      2. Two K‑1s, multi‑state, nonresident filing required, no sale.

13. **`12_GLOSSARY.md`**

    - Define all jargon (UPREIT, OP units, promote/carry, profit interest, phantom equity, §1061, §1231, §1250, 199A dividends, capital gain distributions, nondividend distributions, composite returns, PTET, PALs, etc.) with citations.

14. **`13_SOURCES.md`**

---

## Methodology & quality bar

- **No chain-of-thought**. Provide succinct explanations, tables, and formulas.
- Double‑check arithmetic in any worked examples.
- If reputable sources disagree, note the difference and cite both.
- Always prefer **official IRS** pages for forms/instructions, and **official TurboTax** pages for product capabilities and pricing.
- Clearly date-stamp any prices and indicate if seasonal promos may vary.

---

## Special requirements

- For **1099‑DIV “cost to prepare”**:
  - Distinguish **software** cost (usually included in base tiers) vs **professional** incremental fees (e.g., “add Schedule B/D” line items).
  - Explicitly answer whether added **Schedule B** or **Schedule D** changes the **preparation cost** (software and professional), with numbers from your calculators and supporting sources.
- For each **scenario** (K‑1 Property LLC and UPREIT K‑1 + 1099‑DIV), include whether **profit interests**, **promote**, or **phantom equity** change the forms or schedules, why, and when (e.g., sale events, waterfalls over a pref, §1061 look‑through rules), with citations.
- For **TurboTax**, specify the **base option** (minimum tier) that supports each scenario and show the full cost with state add‑ons, using your calculators.

---

## Output rules

- Return **only** the 14 files above, each in its own fenced code block.
- For **TSV files**, use real **tab characters** between columns and Excel‑style formulas referencing absolute cells to ensure paste‑and‑work behavior when pasted into **A1**.
- Every table row that asserts a capability or price must include a **Source URL** and (if applicable) **Accessed Date**.
- Do not include any narrative outside the files.
