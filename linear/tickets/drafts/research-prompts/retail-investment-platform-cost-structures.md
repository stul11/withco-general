### 4. Cost Efficiency Strategies

- How do platforms achieve cost efficiency at scale?
- What are the key cost drivers and optimization opportunities?
- How do platforms handle cost scaling with growth?
- What are the trade-offs between cost efficiency and service quality?

### 5. Platform Economics Models

- What are typical cost structures for different platform types?
- How do platforms price their services to cover costs?
- What are the key metrics for platform cost management?
- How do platforms balance growth and profitability?
