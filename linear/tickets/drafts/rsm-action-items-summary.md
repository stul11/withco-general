# RSM Call Notes – Action Items Summary

## Goal / Purpose

- Decision enabled: Capture RSM call follow-ups so cost modeling and compliance work can proceed without missing commitments.
- Why now: The September 30 RSM sync surfaced urgent pricing, accounting, and audit tasks tied to LEG-63 timelines.
- Success metric: All priority action items assigned, tracked, and reflected in cost model planning.

## Assumptions

- RSM call notes accurately capture agreements and pricing.
- Jerry Landau is available for property accounting onboarding next week.
- RSM introductions for 1099-DIV providers will land before the next funnel review.
- Shelf finance team will fold new pricing into the Excel model once surfaced.

## Inputs / Dependencies

- Granola transcript of September 30, 2025 call.
- Existing cost model backlog (LEG-63, LEG-9).
- RSM contacts for tax compliance, audit, and property accounting.
- No blocking dependencies, but pricing updates depend on external vendor quotes.

## Deliverable

- Action item tracker grouped by urgency (immediate, medium-term) with owner + timeline.
- Decision summary for structure, minimum checks, and service providers.
- Cost implications summary to feed Excel updates.
- Consumers: Shelf finance team, BF, KS.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

### Fast (same day)

- [ ] Immediate action items documented with owners and due dates.
- [ ] Key decisions summarized and linked to transcript source.
- [ ] Cost implications captured for tax, accounting, and 1099 workflows.

### Standard (2–3 days)

- [ ] Medium-term items sequenced with reminders and review checkpoints.
- [ ] Excel model tasks opened referencing this summary.
- [ ] Follow-up research tasks drafted for investor processing fee comparisons.
- [ ] Audit referral request logged with due date.

### Gold (1–2 weeks)

- [ ] External provider quotes received and attached (1099-DIV, audit).
- [ ] Cost model updated with validated pricing and shared with RSM for confirmation.
- [ ] Workflow adjustments documented for REIT vs LLC scenarios.
- [ ] Stakeholder communication sent summarizing progress and outstanding risks.

## Feedback & Reviews

- Reviewers: BF (cost implications), KS (strategic alignment).
- SLA: Circulate summary before next LEG-63 stand-up.
- Preferred format: Markdown summary + link back to transcript.

## Explicitly Out of Scope

- Drafting new Linear tickets beyond SLF-76/77.
- Negotiating provider contracts.
- Updating legal documentation for REIT restructuring.

## Open Questions

1. Which 1099-DIV provider will we engage after RSM introductions?
2. Do we prefer a single overarching audit vs property-level audits after RSM feedback?
3. How should we handle investor processing fees in pricing models (pass-through vs absorbed)?
4. Are there interim controls needed before automation reduces tax compliance costs?
5. What follow-up cadence should we set with RSM for March 15 compliance deadlines?

## Plan (small steps)

- [ ] Confirm immediate owner assignments with RSM and internal team (same day).
- [ ] Draft Excel model update tasks referencing new pricing (0.5 day).
- [ ] Schedule audit referral follow-up with Joe Musto (within 2 weeks).
- [ ] Collect investor processing fee benchmarks from comparable platforms (1 day).
- [ ] Review progress in weekly LEG-63 sync and update summary (recurring).

## Reviewer Checklist

- [ ] Front matter aligns with ticket template (team, timestamps, related docs).
- [ ] All required sections populated (Goal, Assumptions, Inputs, Deliverable, DoD, Feedback, Scope, Questions, Plan).
- [ ] Decisions and cost implications match transcript details.
- [ ] Appendix references include actionable details for each owner.

## Appendix

### Immediate Action Items (This Week)

1. **Property Accounting Setup** – Owner: Jerry Landau. Schedule next-week session; clean QuickBooks chart; confirm $350/month pricing.
2. **1099-DIV Provider Research** – Owner: Rich (RSM). Collect quotes and introductions; baseline $7–$10 per form + $75 fee.
3. **Update Cost Model with RSM Pricing** – Owner: slittle. Integrate tax compliance, accounting, and 1099 pricing.

### Medium-Term Action Items (Next 2 Weeks)

1. **Audit Requirements Discussion** – Owner: Joe Musto. Identify cost-effective audit options; evaluate consolidated vs property audits.
2. **Research Investor Processing Fees** – Owner: slittle. Compare REIT peers; analyze gross → net investor impact.

### Key Decisions Made

- REIT structure preferred over single LLC due to investor experience (K-1 avoidance).
- Target minimum check sizes: $10K, $1K, $100 per investor tier.
- Property accounting to be handled by Jerry Landau at $350/month per property.

### Cost Implications Summary

- **Upfront**: Tax compliance setup $9K; property accounting $350/month/property; 1099-DIV $7–$10 per form + $75 base.
- **Scaling**: Tax compliance could drop to $2K/entity with automation; 1099-DIV volume pricing TBD.
- **Timeline**: March 15 filings challenging; summer processing with estimates as contingency.
