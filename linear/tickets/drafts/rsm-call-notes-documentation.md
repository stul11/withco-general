# Document RSM Call Notes in Global Work Log

## Goal / Purpose

- Decision enabled: Ensure RSM insights are preserved in the Global Work Log (SLF-73) to unblock cost modeling deliverables.
- Why now: Transcript contains pricing and ownership decisions needed for LEG-63 Excel updates and follow-up tickets.
- Success metric: SLF-73 updated with organized notes, action items, and links; reviewers confirm no gaps.

## Assumptions

- Transcript accurately reflects meeting outcomes.
- Global Work Log (SLF-73) is the canonical repository for this documentation.
- Stakeholders will review updates the same day they are posted.
- Action items can reference existing tickets without new issue creation.

## Inputs / Dependencies

- RSM call transcript (Granola export).
- SLF-73 Global Work Log access.
- Existing LEG-63/LEG-9 documentation for cross-references.
- Dependencies: None; no blockers.

## Deliverable

- Structured summary in SLF-73 containing:
  - Organized notes by topic (structure, pricing, operations).
  - Action items with owners + due dates.
  - Links back to transcript and related tickets.
- Consumers: Shelf finance team, RSM liaisons.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

### Fast (same day)

- [ ] Notes reorganized by topic and added to SLF-73.
- [ ] Action items summarized with owner, priority, due date.
- [ ] Links inserted to transcript and relevant tickets.

### Standard (2–3 days)

- [ ] Follow-up task list posted to TODO Log (Option 3 format).
- [ ] Project status in SLF-73 updated based on outcomes.
- [ ] Review checklist circulated to KS/BF for sign-off.
- [ ] Duplicate content with To-Do project resolved.

### Gold (1–2 weeks)

- [ ] Comprehensive action plan aligned with LEG-63 backlog.
- [ ] Stakeholder communication prepared summarizing RSM partnership scope.
- [ ] Automation opportunities cataloged for documentation updates.
- [ ] Next cadence (weekly sync or similar) scheduled with agenda linked.

## Feedback & Reviews

- Reviewer (scope & accuracy): slittle – same-day verification.
- Secondary reviewer: KS – confirm business priorities (if available).
- SLA: Post summary + ping reviewers before end of day.

## Explicitly Out of Scope

- Creating new Linear projects.
- Modifying company safety or workflow policies.
- Publishing notes outside the approved repositories.

## Open Questions

1. Which sections of SLF-73 require new tags or formatting to host the notes?
2. Do we need a separate appendix for pricing calculators vs narrative summaries?
3. Should RSM contacts be added to stakeholder list in SLF-73?

## Plan (small steps)

- [ ] Review transcript and tag sections by theme (15 min).
- [ ] Draft SLF-73 update with headings + action tables (20 min).
- [ ] Cross-link to related tickets and TODO Log entries (10 min).
- [ ] Request reviewer confirmation and capture feedback (15 min).

## Reviewer Checklist

- [ ] Front matter complete with ISO timestamps and related docs.
- [ ] Required sections populated per ticket template.
- [ ] DoD tiers aligned to Background Agent Draft Review workflow.
- [ ] References and appendix items point to live sources.

### Prior Work

- LEG-63 cost model backlog.
- LEG-9 minimum check analysis.
- Shortcut prompt style guides for ticket outputs.

### Decision Log

- **Decision**: Use SLF-73 Global Work Log for consolidated notes. **Why now**: Centralizes finance workstream context. **Options considered**: SLF-73 vs To-Do project vs ad-hoc doc. **Revisit**: After workflow automation pilot.

### Context Digest

- REIT structure selected over single LLC due to investor experience.
- Tax compliance baseline pricing: $9K (REIT + OP) with potential $2K automation target.
- 1099-DIV provider gap identified; RSM to provide introductions.
- Property accounting support lined up with Jerry Landau at $350/month/property.
