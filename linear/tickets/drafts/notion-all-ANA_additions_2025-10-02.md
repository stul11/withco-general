## Scope

Collected Notion documents referencing analytics, underwriting, CRE pricing, and plane of transactibility created by Stu Little and Kevin Song. Yael Elmatad and Cameron were not found in the Notion user directory; please provide their Notion user IDs or emails to include their authored pages.

## Tier 1 – Proposed high-priority additions (best reference first)

1. Outputs & Key Metrics: SMB Credit UW Investment Memo
   - https://www.notion.so/9eb0b301ae1c4b00910a87ece71cc1bc
2. Capital Structure Resolution
   - https://www.notion.so/1c6fb39c83f7805d9dc2c16c79b0bcde
3. CRE Pricing: 1P CRE Pricing
   - https://www.notion.so/208fb39c83f7808d86f5eee7146f5bb7
4. 1P CRE Price (V2: Current Lease)
   - https://www.notion.so/264fb39c83f780559e9accdf8af10df7
5. 3P CRE Price (V1: Appraisal)
   - https://www.notion.so/264fb39c83f78030a598c7d8198543db
6. Plane of Transactibility (POT)
   - https://www.notion.so/26bfb39c83f780c2a21ed3ed6934c13a
7. Plane of Transactibility
   - https://www.notion.so/26ffb39c83f781e78519ea94a6413845

Notes:

- Existing ANA index already includes: Analytics Overview, Core/Capabilities, Roadmap, Source-of-truth, Data Architecture v2, 5 Key Metrics, CRE Pricing/Transactability/Site Selection, SMB UW, Operating/Deal Projections.
- The above items deepen underwriting logic, price estimation workflows, and POT framing.

## Tier 5 – Legacy and supporting references (optional additions)

- Tenant Credit Underwriting - Data
  - https://www.notion.so/fa8ac563191746fbacd43ecf30823818
- Underwriting CSV Model (WIP)
  - https://www.notion.so/52694128bfd5465cb62844e804c5d546
- Theia: Automated Valuation Model for CRE [old]
  - https://www.notion.so/1bdfb39c83f780429630f1a749852753

## Next steps

- If approved, I’ll integrate Tier 1 items into `linear/ANA/raw/notion-all-ANA.md` under the appropriate sections and keep Tier 5 in legacy. Please share Notion IDs for Yael Elmatad and Cameron to include their authored pages.
