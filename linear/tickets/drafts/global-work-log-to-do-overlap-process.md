# Define Global Work Log and To-Do Project Overlap Process

## Goal / Purpose

- **Decision enabled**: Clear process for managing work across Global Work Log and To-Do & Planning project
- **Why now**: Need to define clear purposes and avoid duplication/confusion
- **Success metric**: Clear guidelines for work item placement and sync between systems

## Assumptions

- **A1**: Both systems should remain integrated but serve different purposes
- **A2**: SLF-73 is for global context and reference
- **A3**: To-Do & Planning project is for global planning and work tracking
- **A4**: Current overlap is causing confusion and inefficiency

## Inputs / Dependencies

- **Input → Source/Owner/Date**:
  - SLF-73 Global Work Log → Linear / Available
  - To-Do & Planning project → Linear / Available
  - RSM call notes → Just documented / Today
  - Current work items → You / Available
- **Upstream dependency**: None
- **Blockers**: None

## Deliverable

- **Artifacts**:
  - Process documentation with clear purposes
  - Decision framework for work item placement
  - Sync mechanisms between systems
  - Guidelines for work item placement
- **Consumers**: You, future work management

## Definition of Done (DoD)

**Fast (same-day)**:

- [ ] Define clear purpose and content guidelines for each system
- [ ] Create decision framework for work item placement
- [ ] Document current overlap areas
- [ ] Create basic process outline

**Standard (2-3 days)**:

- [ ] Create comprehensive process documentation
- [ ] Define sync mechanisms between systems
- [ ] Create guidelines for work item placement
- [ ] Test process with current work items

**Gold (1-2 weeks)**:

- [ ] Implement process across all work
- [ ] Create automation for sync
- [ ] Monitor process effectiveness
- [ ] Refine based on usage patterns

## Feedback & Reviews

- **Reviewer → scope/sign-off**: slittle / Today
- **Reviewer → process/guidelines**: slittle / This week
- **SLA/dates**: Draft today, final this week

## Explicitly Out of Scope

- **OOS1**: Modifying company Linear projects
- **OOS2**: Changing existing safety rules without approval
- **OOS3**: Creating new Linear projects

## Open Questions

1. **Sync frequency**: How often should systems sync?
2. **Automation level**: What level of automation is desired?
3. **Content boundaries**: What specific content goes where?
4. **Workflow integration**: How does this integrate with background agent?

## Plan (small steps)

- [ ] **Define system purposes** (10 min)
- [ ] **Create decision framework** (15 min)
- [ ] **Document current overlap** (10 min)
- [ ] **Create process outline** (15 min)
- [ ] **Test with current work** (10 min)

### Precedents

- Current usage patterns
- Similar process definitions
- Project overlap handling

### Prior Work

- RSM call notes documentation
- Cost modeling work items
- Background agent safety rules

### Data & Queries

- Current overlap areas
- Work item placement decisions
- Sync requirements

### People to Ping / Stakeholders

- slittle (reviewer)
- Background agent (process implementation)

### Decision Log

- **Decision**: Keep both systems integrated but with different purposes **Why now**: Need clear process **Options considered**: Separate/Integrated/Replace **Revisit**: After process implementation

### Context Digest

- SLF-73: Global context and reference
- To-Do & Planning: Global planning and work tracking
- Current overlap causing confusion
- Need clear process for work item placement
- Both systems should remain functional
