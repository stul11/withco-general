# RSM Call Notes - Organized by Topic

**Meeting Date**: Tuesday, September 30, 2025  
**Attendees**: Brian Fetterolf, Kevin Song, Pedowitz, Corey, Kuang, Jamie, Landau, Jerry, Musto, Joe, Riccio, Matt, Graff Jr., Richard  
**Source**: [RSM Call Notes](https://notes.granola.ai/d/90eb97be-343b-453e-9809-a76920b51ff2)

## 1. REIT Structure & Tax Services

### Key Decisions

- **REIT structure preferred over single LLC** due to retail investor K-1 filing costs
- Online tax platforms don't support K-1s out of box
- Target minimum check sizes: $10K, $1K, $100 per investor

### Pricing Information

- **RSM tax compliance pricing**: $9K all-in for REIT + operating partnership testing/compliance
- Covers both REIT and OP tax work
- Potential to reduce to $2K per entity with automation after scale (20+ deals)
- March 15th deadline challenging at scale - would shift to summer processing with estimates

## 2. 1099-DIV Preparation Challenge

### Current Situation

- **RSM cannot provide 1099-DIV services** - lack software/scalability for thousands of forms
- Current market rates: $7-10 per 1099 plus $75 base fee

### Next Steps

- RSM will provide introductions to specialty providers they've researched
- Asked public REIT clients for referrals
- Target first year: ~500 forms, scaling significantly

### Complexity NOTE

- Operating partnership creates administrative complexity
- Adds estimate requirements for OP owners
- No tax benefit but needed for business alignment with tenants

## 3. Property Accounting Scope

### Current Setup

- Current QuickBooks setup needs cleanup - too many unused accounts

### Service Provider

- **Jerry Landau** to provide $350/month per property accounting services
- Expects 10-15 accounts total (simple triple net lease structure)
- Will visit office or schedule detailed screen share session
- QuickBooks acceptable platform vs more expensive alternatives

### Delivery Model

- Trial balance delivery model: OP holds all expenses, REIT stays clean

## 4. Next Steps & Action Items

### Rich (RSM)

- [x] Get actual 1099-DIV provider quotes and introductions from public REIT relationships

### Jerry (Property Accounting)

- [x] Schedule property accounting setup session next week

### RSM Team

- [x] Joe Musto to discuss audit requirements and potential cost-effective audit firm referrals
  - Need annual audited financials for Reg A+ (non-PCAOB firm acceptable)
  - Exploring single overarching audit vs individual property audits
  - Current RSM minimum $50-75K not viable for single property

## 5. Key Insights for Cost Modeling

### Structure Decision Impact

- REIT structure preferred = higher upfront costs but better investor experience
- K-1 filing costs are significant barrier for retail investors
- Online tax platform limitations affect minimum check size strategy

### Cost Implications

- **Tax compliance**: $9K all-in (REIT + OP)
- **1099-DIV preparation**: $7-10 per form + $75 base fee
- **Property accounting**: $350/month per property
- **Audit requirements**: $50-75K minimum (need cost-effective alternatives)

### Scaling Considerations

- Automation potential after 20+ deals
- March 15th deadline challenges at scale
- Summer processing with estimates as alternative
- Single overarching audit vs individual property audits

## 6. Integration with Other Work Items

### Related to Scale Pricing Formulas

- RSM pricing shows scale benefits ($9K â†’ $2K with automation)
- Need to incorporate these cost curves into formulas

### Related to Accruing Pref Modeling

- REIT structure impacts preferred return calculations
- OP complexity affects administrative costs

### Related to Investor Processing Fees Research

- 1099-DIV preparation costs are significant
- Need to research how other platforms handle these costs
- Consider gross â†’ net impact on investor returns
