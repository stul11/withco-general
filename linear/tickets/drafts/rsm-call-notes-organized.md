# RSM Call Notes – Organized by Topic

## Goal / Purpose

- Decision enabled: Provide a structured reference of the September 30 RSM call to accelerate downstream ticketing and modeling.
- Why now: Transcript is long-form; sorting by topic shortens onboarding time for finance and legal reviewers.
- Success metric: Each topic area has clear insights, next steps, and cost implications linked to owners.

## Assumptions

- Transcript content is authoritative.
- Listed attendees account for all decision makers.
- Pricing figures quoted remain valid until superseded by vendor quotes.
- Future tickets will reference these sections rather than duplicating raw transcript text.

## Inputs / Dependencies

- Granola transcript (linked above).
- Existing LEG-63, LEG-9 modeling requirements.
- RSM pricing baseline.
- Dependencies: None blocking, but vendor introductions pending.

## Deliverable

- Topic-organized summary covering structure, tax services, 1099-DIV process, property accounting, next steps, and integration points.
- Consumers: Shelf finance team, BF, KS, RSM liaisons.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

### Fast (same day)

- [ ] Topics segmented with headings and bullet insights.
- [ ] Key decisions and pricing captured per section.
- [ ] Action owners tagged for each follow-up.

### Standard (2–3 days)

- [ ] Cross-links inserted to related tickets and TODO items.
- [ ] Integration notes added for cost modeling tasks.
- [ ] Reviewer checklist completed and feedback incorporated.

### Gold (1–2 weeks)

- [ ] Append supporting exhibits (pricing tables, org charts).
- [ ] Sync schedule established with RSM for outstanding items.
- [ ] Summary distributed to leadership with acknowledgement logged.

## Feedback & Reviews

- Reviewers: BF (financial accuracy), KS (strategic fit).
- SLA: Provide review-ready summary before cost model update cycle.

## Explicitly Out of Scope

- Negotiating pricing changes.
- Publishing notes outside internal repositories.
- Creating new policy documents.

## Open Questions

1. Do we need a separate appendix for provider contacts once introductions land?
2. Should we track RSM automation milestones in this doc or a separate ticket?
3. What evidence is required to verify the $2K automation target?

## Plan (small steps)

- [ ] Extract transcript themes and populate sections (1 hr).
- [ ] Add decision + pricing callouts with owners (30 min).
- [ ] Cross-link to action summary + documentation tickets (15 min).
- [ ] Review with BF/KS for confirmation (30 min).

## Reviewer Checklist

- [ ] Front matter matches template and includes ISO timestamps.
- [ ] Sections align with ticket best practices (Goal → Plan).
- [ ] Every topic lists owner, pricing, and integration notes.
- [ ] Links to transcript and related tickets verified.

## Appendix

### Meeting Metadata

- **Meeting Date**: 2025-09-30 (Tuesday).
- **Attendees**: Brian Fetterolf, Kevin Song, Pedowitz, Corey, Kuang, Jamie, Landau, Jerry, Musto, Joe, Riccio, Matt, Graff Jr., Richard.

### Topic Summaries

#### 1. REIT Structure & Tax Services

- REIT structure preferred over single LLC due to investor experience (K-1 avoidance).
- RSM tax compliance pricing: $9K all-in for REIT + operating partnership; potential to reduce to $2K/entity after automation (20+ deals).
- March 15 filing deadline challenging; summer processing with estimates considered.

#### 2. 1099-DIV Preparation Challenge

- RSM cannot provide 1099-DIV service at scale; current rates $7–$10 per form + $75 base.
- RSM to provide introductions to specialty providers from REIT network.
- Operating partnership introduces administrative complexity and estimate requirements.

#### 3. Property Accounting Scope

- QuickBooks cleanup required (excess accounts); 10–15 account target for triple net lease.
- Jerry Landau to deliver services at $350/month per property; trial balance approach keeps REIT clean.

#### 4. Next Steps & Action Items

- Rich (RSM): Gather 1099-DIV provider quotes and intros.
- Jerry Landau: Schedule accounting setup session.
- Joe Musto (RSM): Explore audit options and referrals (current $50–$75K minimum too high).

#### 5. Key Insights for Cost Modeling

- Integrate RSM pricing into cost model.
- Reflect REIT structure in accruing pref modeling.
- Research investor processing fees and pass-through strategy.
