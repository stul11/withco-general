# Background Agent Documentation and Testing Framework

## Goal / Purpose

- **Decision enabled**: Safe implementation of background agent for personal work management
- **Why now**: Need to validate safety rules and demonstrate workflow integration
- **Success metric**: Complete documentation with validated safety framework

## Assumptions

- **A1**: Safety rules are correctly implemented and active
- **A2**: Global To-Do project is accessible and functional
- **A3**: Ticket wizard workflow is well-defined and tested
- **A4**: Company Linear projects are protected and read-only

## Inputs / Dependencies

- **Input → Source/Owner/Date**:
  - Safety rules → Agent / Today
  - Global To-Do project → Linear / Available
  - Ticket wizard script → Agent / Available
  - Best practices → Agent / Available
- **Upstream dependency**: None
- **Blockers**: None

## Deliverable

- **Artifacts**:
  - Comprehensive documentation
  - Test framework and cases
  - User guide and best practices
  - Safety validation results
- **Consumers**: slittle, future agent users

## Definition of Done (DoD)

**Fast (same-day)**:

- [ ] Create basic documentation structure
- [ ] Document safety rules and safeguards
- [ ] Create test framework outline
- [ ] Validate safety rules work correctly

**Standard (2-3 days)**:

- [ ] Complete comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Implement full test suite
- [ ] Validate all safety scenarios
- [ ] Create user guide and best practices

**Gold (1-2 weeks)**:

- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Advanced monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Integration with additional tools
- [ ] Comprehensive user training

## Feedback & Reviews

- **Reviewer → scope/sign-off**: slittle / Today
- **Reviewer → safety/validation**: Background agent / Today
- **SLA/dates**: Draft today, final tomorrow

## Explicitly Out of Scope

- **OOS1**: Modifying company Linear projects
- **OOS2**: Changing existing safety rules without approval
- **OOS3**: Creating new Linear projects

## Open Questions

1. **Performance impact**: What's the performance impact of safety checks?
2. **Monitoring frequency**: How often should safety rules be validated?
3. **User training**: What level of training is needed for users?

## Plan (small steps)

- [ ] **Review existing safety rules** (10 min)
- [ ] **Create documentation structure** (15 min)
- [ ] **Implement test cases** (20 min)
- [ ] **Validate safety rules** (10 min)
- [ ] **Create user guide** (15 min)
