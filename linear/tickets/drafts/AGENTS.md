# Agent Guidelines

## Ticket Wizard Workflow

When creating or updating Linear tickets, follow the Ticket Wizard conversation flow. Confirm the request, gather context, and tighten the summary before handing it off. Use the ticket template at `docs/templates/linear/ticket-template.md` and store drafts under `linear/tickets/drafts/` unless instructed otherwise. Never push to Linear automaticallyâ€”share the prepared output with the user for review.
