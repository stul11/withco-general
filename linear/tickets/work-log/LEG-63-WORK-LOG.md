## 🎯 **KEY DECISIONS & CONTEXT**

### **Structure Choice**

- **UPREIT vs LLC** - Need cost comparison for decision
- **Two-tiered minimum** - Existing vs new investor structure
- **Reg A+ compliance** - Must meet SEC requirements

### **Critical Assumptions**

- **A1:** RSM inputs available Sep 29
- **A2:** REIT compliance accountant identified by Minta/Goodwin
- **A3:** Current Excel model contains necessary vendor data
- **A4:** Two-tiered minimum structure is viable approach

### **Blockers**

- **RSM inputs** - Pending (Sep 29)
- **REIT compliance accountant** - Pending (Minta/Goodwin)

## 📝 **NOTES & OBSERVATIONS**

- **Urgent timeline** - Draft needed today for tomorrow's review
- **Integration required** - Must work with LEG-9 minimum check analysis
- **Two-tiered focus** - Key differentiator for our platform
- **Reg A+ specific** - Not generic cost accounting, platform-specific patterns needed
