# DATA/ANA Project Documentation Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines a comprehensive approach to create additional documentation and context for all DATA and ANA Projects that are not yet completed and are tied to the "10/27 super initiative" (or similar timeline-based initiatives). The goal is to establish a standardized documentation framework that captures project context, historical work, and resources for better project management and knowledge retention.

## Maureen's CTO Requirements

All DATA and ANA project documentation must include:

- **Explicit value creation first**: State the primary value(s) the project delivers (e.g., time saved, risk reduction, operational efficiency, user ease of use), with quantified targets (e.g., "lease processing from ~2 hours to ~15 minutes")
- **Clear definition of done tied to value**: What must be true at launch to achieve that value (not just "endpoint exists")
- **Success metrics/specs**: Accuracy, coverage, confidence, consistency, speed/latency, ease-of-use/ops touchpoints
- **User/consumer focus**: Who consumes the output (SMB, investor, internal ops) and how it improves their flow
- **Near-term scope vs later**: What's in V1 vs V2 to hit the 10/27 milestone
- **Operational hooks**: Tools/UX needed for humans to correct/update model outputs if time-saving is the goal
- **Dependencies and milestones**: Phased steps with dates to track progress company-wide (milestones show up on a Gantt)

### 10/27 Super Initiative Context

While specific references to a "10/27 super initiative" were not found in the current Linear data, several projects have target dates around October 2025, suggesting a coordinated timeline. The super initiative concept aligns with Linear's definition: "a specific timeline around which we rally large streams of work."

## Proposed Documentation Framework

### 1. Standardized Project Document Form

Each project will have a comprehensive markdown document following the structure defined in `project-documentation-example.md`.

### 2. Folder Structure

For each identified project, create the following folder structure:

```

linear/DATA/projects/[project-name]/
├── README.md (Project overview document)
├── GLOSSARY.md (Project glossary; follow `project-glossary-example.md`)
├── docs/
│ ├── requirements.md
│ ├── architecture.md
│ ├── decisions.md
│ └── resources.md
├── raw/
│ ├── research/
│ ├── notes/
│ └── external-links.md
└── archive/
└── [completed-work]

linear/ANA/projects/[project-name]/
├── README.md (Project overview document)
├── GLOSSARY.md (Project glossary; follow `project-glossary-example.md`)
├── docs/
│ ├── requirements.md
│ ├── architecture.md
│ ├── decisions.md
│ └── resources.md
├── raw/
│ ├── research/
│ ├── notes/
│ └── external-links.md
└── archive/
└── [completed-work]

```

### Phase 2: Document Template Development (Week 1-2)

1. **Design Standardized Forms**

   - Use `project-documentation-example.md` as the project document template
   - Use `project-glossary-example.md` as the glossary template
   - Define required vs. optional sections
   - Establish naming conventions

2. **Create Folder Structure**
   - Set up project folders for each identified project
   - Create initial README.md files
   - Establish raw capture directories

### Phase 3: Historical Work Collection (Week 2-3)

1. **Linear Integration**

   - Use Linear MCP to gather all related issues
   - Extract project descriptions, milestones, and requirements
   - Capture decision history and comments

2. **External Resource Gathering**

   - Search Google Drive for project-related documents
   - Use Notion to search for project-related documents
   - Identify research materials and external links
   - Document code repositories and technical resources

3. **Context Documentation**
   - Interview project leads for additional context
   - Document lessons learned from previous iterations
   - Capture business rationale and success criteria

### Phase 4: Document Creation & Review (Week 3-4)

1. **Initial Document Creation**

   - Populate template for each project
   - Fill in available information from Linear and external sources
   - Identify gaps requiring additional research

2. **Review & Validation**
   - Project lead review of initial documentation
   - Stakeholder feedback and corrections
   - Final approval and publication

### Phase 5: Maintenance & Updates (Ongoing)

1. **Regular Updates**

   - Weekly status updates during active development
   - Decision log maintenance
   - Resource link validation

2. **Archive Management**
   - Move completed work to archive folders
   - Update project status and lessons learned
   - Maintain historical context for future iterations

## Resource Requirements

### Time Estimates

- **Project Identification**: 4 hours
- **Template Development**: 8 hours
- **Historical Collection**: 16 hours (2 hours per project)

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks

1. **Incomplete Historical Context**: Some projects may lack detailed history

   - _Mitigation_: Focus on available information, NOTE gaps for future research

2. **Resource Access**: Limited access to external systems (Google Drive, etc.)

   - _Mitigation_: Work with project leads to gather external resources

3. **Timeline Pressure**: October 2025 deadlines may create urgency

   - _Mitigation_: Prioritize projects by target date and business impact

4. **Template Adoption**: Teams may resist standardized documentation
   - _Mitigation_: Involve teams in template design, emphasize benefits
