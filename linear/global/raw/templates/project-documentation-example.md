# [Project Name] - Project Documentation

## Value Creation & Impact

### Primary Value Delivered

- **[Value Type]**: [Quantified impact] (e.g., "Lease processing from ~2 hours to ~15 minutes")
- **[Value Type]**: [Quantified impact] (e.g., "Risk reduction: 90% accuracy in lease data extraction")
- **[Value Type]**: [Quantified impact] (e.g., "Operational efficiency: 50% reduction in manual review time")

### Definition of Done (Value-Focused)

- **[Value Metric]**: [Specific threshold] (e.g., "Processing time â‰¤ 15 minutes per lease")
- **[Value Metric]**: [Specific threshold] (e.g., "Accuracy â‰¥ 90% on key lease fields")
- **[Value Metric]**: [Specific threshold] (e.g., "Coverage â‰¥ 95% of common lease types")

## Context

### What is it?

[Describe what this project is and what it does]

### Why is it important?

[Explain the business justification and importance]

## Existing Functionality

### v[1.0]

- [We take "as-reported" financial statements from Rutter]
- [We map the SMB's "chart of accounts" to a standardized chart of accounts using LLM]
- [We determine a cutoff date]
- [We calculate Year-to-Date annualized EBTDARM from the income statement]
- [We do a back of envelope calculation to determine cash balance at the end of the cutoff date year]
- [These items are inputs into plane of transactability]

## Existing Issues

### v[1.0]

- [No correction or corroboration of historical financials.]
- [If corrected and corroborated this logic is still bare minimum and was created defensively when we decided the customer product would show a calendar year]
- [SMB customers and capital partners may not be familiar with our chart of accounts schema]

## Ideal Functionality

- [To Be Updated - describe ideal state]

## Risks & Challenges

### [ðŸ“˜ **Financial Statement Structure & Scope**]

- [**Entity scope:** The financial statements may represent one or more legal entities or locations.]
- [**Statement timeliness:** The financial statements may not be up to date.]
- [**Business line segmentation:** We do not understand the segments of business lines and what is attributable to a specific location vs. other locations vs online.]
- [**Chart of accounts granularity:** The as-reported chart of accounts may not provide specificity into the items required to appropriately make adjustments for the EBTDAR calculation]
- [**Chart of accounts variability:** Chart of accounts may change over time.]

---

### [ðŸ§® **Accounting Practices & Methodology**]

- [**Tax vs accounting basis:** Certain Capital Providers require tax driven calculations, vs. accounting statements]
- [**SBA reconciliation requirement:** The SBA requires a reconciliation between accounting and tax information.]
- [**Accrual compliance:** Financial statements may not on proper accrual accounting standards]
- [Obscures timing of revenue and expenses, especially for businesses with significant accounts receivable or payable]
- [**Inventory cost accuracy:** Accounting may be inaccurate or non-existent impacting costs of goods sold and gross margin calculations]
- [**Capitalization vs expensing:** Assets may be expensed instead of capitalized or vice versa. Or depreciation may not follow standard methods.]
- [**Fixed vs variable costs:** The as reported chart of accounts may not provide specificity into fixed versus variable costs]
- [**Income tax formation dependence:** Income taxes are dependent on the legal formation]

---

### [ðŸ“‰ **Reported Performance vs. Economic Reality**]

- [**Performance misreporting:** Businesses may misreport the performance of the business e.g., to minimize taxes]
- [**Non-market salaries:** Business owners may be taking a non-market salary]
- [**One-time items:** There may be one-time items in the historicals that do not reflect the "normalized" state of the business.]
- [**Non-recurring vs recurring:** When only looking at the financial statements, we don't understand the nature of recurring revenue, contracts, or the concentration of the customer base.]
- [**Personal expenses:** Owners may run personal or discretionary expenses through the business]
- [**Historical period limitations:** Whichever period we choose may not reflect the future state of the business]

---

### [ðŸ’¸ **Liabilities & Capital Structure**]

- [**Liabilities and equity unknowns:** We do not understand the nature and terms of the liabilities equity of the business]
- [**Unrecorded liabilities:** There may be unrecorded or contingent liabilities.]
- **Intercompany ambiguity:** Intercompany transactions may not be correctly accounted for, or opaque.

---

### [ðŸ’³ **Revenue Recognition & Payment Systems**]

- [**POS revenue timing:** POS integration may obfuscate the timing of revenues]
- [**Embedded finance revenue:** Embedded Finance providers such as Stripe may cause revenues to be underreported and include embedded interest]
- [**Alternative payment timing:** Venmo or other similar payment systems may create lumpiness in revenue recognition]

---

### [ðŸ§  **Data Reliability & Analysis Challenges**]

- [**Projection quality:** These are potential problems we may face dealing with stay deals, before taking into account]
  - [**Garbage in garbage out:** These problems create garbage in, garbage out issues for projecting future business performance.]
  - [**Data integration strategy:** We need to use a combination of 1P, 3P data, ML, business logic, and documents to minimize the effort required by an SMB or a capital provider arrive at an appropriate calculations with transparency]
    - [**Atomic integration path:** We may need to integrate into POS systems or build up from atomic accounting info to address these issues.]
