# Background Agent Test Execution

## Test Session: Sample Work Item Management

### Test Objective
Execute background agent test with a sample work item to demonstrate ticket wizard workflow and Global To-Do project integration.

### Safety Status
- ✅ Safety rules active
- ✅ Global To-Do project: `to-do-and-planning-e2ce95344374`
- ✅ Personal work scope: `linear/tickets/drafts/`, `docs/agents/`, `docs/global/`
- ✅ Company Linear: Read-only access only

## Phase 1: Ticket Wizard Session

### 1.1 Boot Phase
**Agent**: Activating Ticket Wizard mode. Locating best practices...

**Safety Check**: ✅ Reading `docs/global/GLB-TKT_Best_Practices.md` - ALLOWED
**Safety Check**: ✅ Reading `linear/docs/templates/ticket-template.md` - ALLOWED

**Agent**: Found ticket best practices and template. Ready to begin conversation.

### 1.2 Triage Phase
**Agent**: Let's start with the basics for your work item:

**Sample Work Item**: "Create background agent documentation and testing framework"

**Questions**:
1. **Working title/type/due date**: "Background Agent Documentation" / "Documentation" / "2025-01-28"
2. **Primary deliverable format**: "Markdown documentation with test cases"
3. **DoD tier**: "Standard (2-3 days)"

**Domain suggestion**: **Data** - Research, analysis, documentation

### 1.3 Context Collection
**Agent**: Please share any relevant links, docs, prior tickets or models, and why they matter.

**Context provided**:
- **Links & Resources**: 
  - `docs/global/GBL-PRD_Best_Practices.md` - PRD template structure
  - `linear/docs/How to use Linear.md` - Linear workflow compliance
  - `docs/agents/templates/` - Agent artifact templates
- **Precedents**: 
  - Previous agent session notes for structure
  - Decision docket for decision tracking
  - TODO log for task management
- **Prior Work**: 
  - Existing safety rules framework
  - Ticket wizard conversation script
  - Global To-Do project structure

### 1.4 DoD + Plan
**Agent**: Proposing 3-tier DoD with binary checks and evidence:

**Fast (same-day)**:
- [ ] Create basic documentation structure
- [ ] Document safety rules and safeguards
- [ ] Create test framework outline
- [ ] Validate safety rules work correctly

**Standard (2-3 days)**:
- [ ] Complete comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Implement full test suite
- [ ] Validate all safety scenarios
- [ ] Create user guide and best practices

**Gold (1-2 weeks)**:
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Advanced monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Integration with additional tools
- [ ] Comprehensive user training

**Task Plan (20-60 minutes)**:
1. **Review existing safety rules** (10 min)
2. **Create documentation structure** (15 min)
3. **Implement test cases** (20 min)
4. **Validate safety rules** (10 min)
5. **Create user guide** (15 min)

### 1.5 Risks, OOS, Reviewers
**Agent**: Let me ask about:

**Must-not-break guardrails**:
- Company Linear projects must remain untouched
- Safety rules must be enforced
- Audit trail must be maintained

**Out-of-scope**:
- Modifying company Linear projects
- Changing existing safety rules without approval
- Creating new Linear projects

**Reviewers**: 
- You (slittle) for final approval
- Background agent for safety validation

**Review dates**: 
- Draft review: Today
- Final review: Tomorrow

### 1.6 Output
**Agent**: Returning "Beautiful Ticket" block matching `TKT_Best_Practices.md` structure:
