# Agent Offboarding Rule

When offboarding an agent session, follow `docs/agents/checklists/Agent_Offboarding_Checklist.md` and ensure every box below is checked before closing the session.

## Pre-Offboarding Checklist

- [ ] All file changes saved and staged; git status is clean or intentionally staged for the next agent
- [ ] Session NOTE in `docs/agents/session-notes/` updated with current work, blockers, and remaining scope
- [ ] Decision Docket (`docs/global/Decision_Docket.md`) captures decisions made during the session
- [ ] TODO Log (`docs/global/TODO_Log.md`) reflects outstanding work with owners and status
- [ ] Risks, mitigations, and follow-up items recorded for the next agent

## Offboarding Actions

- [ ] Revoke or expire temporary credentials or scoped tokens issued for the session
- [ ] Clear local secrets, environment variables, and temporary configuration files
- [ ] Remove scratch assets and ephemeral artifacts that should not persist
- [ ] Stage or commit final code/documentation changes with a descriptive message
- [ ] Attach validation artifacts (test output, `pre-commit` results) to the Session NOTE or repository as appropriate

## Required Files to Update

1. **Session NOTE**: Use `docs/agents/templates/Session_Note_Template.md`; store in `docs/agents/session-notes/`
2. **Decision Docket**: Update `docs/global/Decision_Docket.md`
3. **TODO Log**: Update `docs/global/TODO_Log.md`
4. **Checklist Archive**: Save the completed checklist alongside the Session NOTE for audit readiness
5. **Git Commit**: Include all changes with a descriptive message documenting the session closure

## Session NOTE Naming Convention

- Format: `SN_YYYYMMDD-HHMM_slug.md`
- Example: `SN_20251002-2100_scripts-docs-improvements.md`

## Commit Message Format

- Format: `feat: <summary> - Session: <slug>`
- Example: `feat: finalize onboarding collateral - Session: agent-onboarding`
