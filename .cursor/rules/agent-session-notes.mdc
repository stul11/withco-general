# Agent Session Notes Rule

## Overview

When an agent session edits files in PRDs, agents, or global documentation directories, a Session NOTE MUST be created to document the work performed, decisions made, and outcomes achieved.

## Trigger Conditions

This rule applies when any files are modified in:

- `docs/prds/` - Product Requirements Documents
- `docs/agents/` - Agent workflows, templates, session notes
- `docs/global/` - Global standards, best practices, tracking docs

## Required Actions

### Session NOTE Creation

- [ ] Create Session NOTE using template from `docs/agents/templates/Session_Note_Template.md`
- [ ] Follow naming convention: `SN_YYYYMMDD-HHMM_slug-with-dashes.md` (24-hour UTC) - HHMM is the CREATED timestamp rounded down to the nearest 15 minutes (00, 15, 30, 45) - Filename is IMMUTABLE after creation; do not rename on updates - Confirm slug manually at creation time
- [ ] Document all objectives, steps taken, outputs, and decisions
- [ ] Include citations to relevant files and line ranges
- [ ] Identify risks and next actions
      [ ] Include minimal frontmatter (`type: session-NOTE`, `created`, `updated`, optional `team`, `tags`)
      [ ] Choose Full vs Lite skeleton at creation time and ensure all required sections are present

### Human Signoff

- [ ] Obtain human review and approval before session completion
- [ ] Update Decision Docket with key decisions made
- [ ] Update TODO Log with completed and carryover items
- [ ] Commit all changes with descriptive commit message
      [ ] When creating TODO/TOPLAN via commands, include `source:` back-link to the originating NOTE section

## Session NOTE Requirements

### Required Sections

- **Task ID**: Brief description of main task
- **Agent**: Agent type/name
- **Owner**: Human owner
- **Date**: ISO 8601 timestamp
- **Inputs**: Key documents, files, context provided
- **Steps Taken**: Major actions and decisions
- **Outputs**: Files created/modified with paths
- **Citations**: Links to specific files and line ranges
- **Risks Identified**: Potential issues or concerns
- **Next Actions**: Follow-up items and carryover
- **Signoff**: Human reviewer approval

### Quality Standards

- Complete documentation of all work performed
- Clear rationale for decisions made
- Proper citations to source materials
- Actionable next steps identified
- Human approval obtained

## Enforcement

### Pre-Completion Checks

Before ending an agent session:

- [ ] Session NOTE created and complete
- [ ] All required sections populated
- [ ] Human review obtained
- [ ] Decision Docket updated
- [ ] TODO Log updated
- [ ] Git commit prepared

### Failure Response

If Session NOTE requirements not met:

1. **Halt session completion** until requirements satisfied
2. **Remind agent** of Session NOTE requirements
3. **Provide guidance** on missing elements
4. **Require completion** before proceeding

- **Agent**: GPT-5-Pro
- **Owner**: slittle

- **Duration**: ~2 hours

## Inputs

- withco-general/linear/docs/How to use Linear.md
- .cursor/rules/planning-mode.mdc
- User requirements for PRD templates

## Steps Taken

- Analyzed Linear workflow structure
- Collaboratively defined V3 front matter schema
- Created two distinct PRD templates

## Outputs

- withco-general/docs/global/GBL-PRD_Best_Practices.md
- withco-general/docs/global/TODO_Log.md
- .cursor/rules/agent-offboarding.mdc

## Citations

## Risks Identified

- None significant identified
- TODO list continuity requires discipline

## Next Actions

- Create remaining PRDs from finalized templates
- Implement agent artifacts framework
- Test offboarding process
