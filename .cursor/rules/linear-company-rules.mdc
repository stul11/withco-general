# Linear Workflow Compliance for withco-team

When working on withco-team projects, ALWAYS ensure compliance with the latest Linear workflow documentation located at `/withco-general/linear/docs/How to use Linear.md`.

> READ-ONLY: `How to use Linear.md` is a company document. Do not modify it from this repo. Personal drafting preferences must live under `docs/global/` (e.g., `GLB-TKT_Best_Practices.md`, `GBL-PRD_Best_Practices.md`). Agents must not mix company workflow documentation with personal best practices.

This is especially critical when:

## High Priority (Must Follow)

- **Initiative PRDs**: Follow the initiative anatomy structure
- **Project PRDs**: Include Problem/Solution sections with proper scoping
- **Milestone Definition**: Ensure 1-3 week scope with clear requirements
- **Requirements/Issues**: Must have clear definition of done, <1 week scope per IC

## Medium Priority (Should Follow)

- **Linear MCP Operations**: When using Linear MCP tools, follow team structure (Product, Legal, Analytics, Data)
- **Project Status Management**: Use Backlog → Planned → In Progress progression
- **Cycle Management**: Ensure active work is in current cycle (To do/In Progress status)
- **Documentation**: Use Linear documents over Notion links when possible

## Key Compliance Points

### Vocabulary & Hierarchy

- **Super Initiative**: Global timeline-based work streams
- **Initiative**: Indefinite company value work (versioned as v1, v2, etc.)
- **Project**: 4-10 week scoped outcomes
- **Milestone**: 1-3 week requirement collections
- **Requirement**: <1 week individual work units

### Project Structure Requirements

### Milestone Standards

- Tightly scoped to 1-3 weeks
- Clear definitions of done for each requirement
- Target end-dates for accountability
- Requirements must be agreed upon before project begins

### Issue/Requirement Standards

- Very clear definition of done
- Scoped for single IC completion in <1 week
- Larger work should be broken into milestones
- Use "Convert list to issues" for milestone requirements

### Communication Standards

- Use project updates for progress (not comments)
- Weekly Friday updates minimum
- Post updates for milestone changes/completions
- Use discussion threads for fine-grained work details

### Team Structure

- 4 teams: Product, Legal, Analytics, Data
- All projects have 2 initiatives: team-specific + global super initiative
- Use workspace-level labels, not team-level
- Avoid sub-issues for company-wide visibility

## Enforcement

- **Critical**: Initiative/Project PRDs and milestone scoping
- **Important**: All Linear MCP operations and document scoping
- **Recommended**: General ticket work and cycle management
