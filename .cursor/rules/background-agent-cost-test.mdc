## Test Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Ticket Wizard Sessions

1. Run ticket wizard for each work item
2. Generate "Beautiful Ticket" outputs
3. Create 3-tier DoD with binary checks
4. Establish review and approval processes

### Phase 2: Global To-Do Integration

2. Establish bidirectional sync
3. Track progress and dependencies
4. Maintain priority ordering

### Phase 3: Safety Validation

1. Test prohibited operations (SLF-73 modifications)
2. Validate allowed operations (Global To-Do)
3. Verify audit trail maintenance
4. Confirm safety rule enforcement

### Phase 4: Overlap Resolution

1. Define process for Global Work Log vs To-Do overlap
2. Create guidelines for work item placement
3. Establish sync mechanisms
4. Test process effectiveness

## Expected Results

### ‚úÖ **Successful Operations**

- All work items converted to ticket wizard sessions
- All work items added to Global To-Do project
- All safety rules enforced correctly
- All progress tracked accurately

### ‚ùå **Blocked Operations**

- No modifications to SLF-73 or company Linear
- No unauthorized Linear operations
- No safety rule violations
- No context leakage between systems

### üìä **Process Improvements**

- Clear process for work item placement
- Efficient sync between Global Work Log and To-Do
- Improved work organization and tracking
- Enhanced collaboration and visibility

## Next Steps

1. **Execute Test Cases**: Run each test case to demonstrate capabilities
2. **Validate Safety**: Confirm all safety rules work correctly
3. **Define Overlap Process**: Create clear guidelines for work item placement
4. **Implement Process**: Apply the defined process to actual work
5. **Monitor Effectiveness**: Track process performance and improvements

## Conclusion

This test demonstrates how the background agent can handle real work items while maintaining safety and efficiency. The overlap between Global Work Log and To-Do & Planning project is a common challenge that the agent can help resolve through clear process definition and efficient work management.
