<!-- Granola paste-based ingestion rules: normalization, safety, and outputs -->

# Granola Review Rules

## Scope

- Operates entirely on pasted content from Granola; no API usage.
- Accepts two blocks: Actions_Template and Auto-generated summary.
- Produces markdown artifacts and preview messages only.

## Safety

- Follow Background Agent Safety Rules.
- Writes allowed only to:
  - docs/agents/session-notes/
  - docs/global/Decision_Docket.md
  - docs/global/TODO_Log.md
  - linear/tickets/drafts/
- Company Linear projects: read-only; Notion changes are suggestions only.

## Normalization

- Dates: ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD for due dates; created/updated timestamps with Z).
- Priorities: P0, P1, P2, P3; flag others for manual correction.
- Owners: keep names as provided; map to emails only if explicitly supplied.
- Source: retain transcript URL and minimal quote; include timestamps when available.
- Meeting slug: `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<kebab-title>` used for filenames and tags.

## Outputs

1. Session Note: `docs/agents/session-notes/SN_ISO_MEETINGSLUG.md`
2. Decision Docket: append structured entries under Recent Decisions
3. TODO Log: append checklist items with owner, due, priority, tags
4. Ticket Drafts: create markdown files in `linear/tickets/drafts/`

## Review Checklist

- Verify due dates and timestamps are ISO 8601
- Ensure decisions include rationale and alternatives
- Tickets include clear acceptance criteria
- Risks list severity, likelihood, and next steps
