# Date-Time Format Rule

When adding or updating front matter in documentation files (PRDs, ADRs, Research Requests), you **MUST** ensure that any `created` and `updated` fields include both the date and the time.

## Required Format

The required format is `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` (ISO 8601).

- **ALWAYS** include the time.
- **ALWAYS** use UTC (indicated by `Z`).

## Examples

✅ **Correct**:

```yaml
created: 2025-09-27T14:30:00Z
updated: 2025-09-27T15:00:00Z
```

❌ **Incorrect**:

```yaml
created: 2025-09-27
updated: 2025-09-27
```
