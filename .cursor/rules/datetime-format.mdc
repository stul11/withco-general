# Date-Time Format Rule (Eastern Time, Compact)

When adding or updating front matter in documentation files (PRDs, ADRs, Research Requests), you **MUST** ensure that any `created` and `updated` fields include both the date and the time, and that the timestamp uses Eastern Time (ET) in a compact format rounded down to the nearest 15 minutes.

## Required Format

Use `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM` (24h) with HHMM ∈ {00, 15, 30, 45} minutes, representing ET time (EDT/EST) rounded down to the nearest 15 minutes.

- **ALWAYS** include the time as HHMM.
- **ALWAYS** use ET; rounding down to the nearest 15 minutes.
- Legacy formats with UTC `Z` or ET offsets (`-04:00`/`-05:00`) are permitted only for existing content; new content must use the compact format.

## Examples

✅ **Correct (Compact ET)**:

```yaml
created: 2025-10-02-0930
updated: 2025-10-02-1100
```

❌ **Incorrect**:

```yaml
created: 2025-09-27
updated: 2025-09-27
```

ℹ️ Legacy examples (allowed for existing docs, not for new content):

```yaml
created: 2025-09-27T14:30:00Z
updated: 2025-09-27T15:00:00Z

created: 2025-10-02T09:30:00-04:00
updated: 2025-10-02T11:00:00-04:00
```
