# Markdown Best Practices

## Core Expectations

- Keep lines ≤ 120 characters unless a URL or code snippet must remain unwrapped.
- Use ATX headings (`#`, `##`, `###`) with one H1 per document.
- Maintain sequential ordered list numbering; indent nested list items by two spaces.
- Use descriptive link text instead of bare URLs; prefer relative paths for internal links.
- Provide language identifiers for fenced code blocks (` ```bash `, ` ```json `, etc.); use `text` if none applies.
- Prefer tables only when they add clarity; otherwise, use lists for scanability.
- Capitalize headings in sentence case unless an external spec requires otherwise.

## File Editing Workflow

1. Preserve existing front matter, metadata comments, and reference anchors.
2. Align wording with project terminology (see `docs/global/glossary/APPROVED-GLOSSARY.md`).
3. Introduce callouts with the standard pattern:

   ```markdown
   > **Note**
   > Explanation text.
   ```

4. Update backlinks when moving or renaming files; validate relative links afterwards.
5. Run `markdownlint --fix path/to/file.md` (or `. ``) after significant changes.
6. Resolve every markdownlint warning prior to handing work off or opening a PR.

## Generated Markdown Responses

- Match the repository voice: concise, direct, collaborative.
- Keep bullet lists short (≤ 6 items) and avoid nested bullets unless structure demands it.
- Wrap commands/files/env vars in backticks; reserve bold for emphasis or section headers.
- Include verification steps or follow-up actions when edits require validation.
- Surface assumptions explicitly when context is missing; do not speculate.

## Common Lint Failures to Watch

- `MD013`: Break long paragraphs or lists to respect the 120-character limit.
- `MD025`: Ensure a single H1 heading per document.
- `MD024`: Keep heading labels unique.
- `MD029`: Fix numbering after reordering or inserting list items.
- `MD040`: Add language tags to every fenced code block.
- `MD046`: Prefer fenced code blocks over indented code blocks.

## Helpful Commands

```bash
# Format entire repository (slower)
markdownlint --fix .

# Format specific files
markdownlint --fix docs/path/to/file.md

# Repository link and timestamp validation
python3 scripts/check_markdown_links.py
python3 scripts/validate_iso_timestamps.py docs
```
