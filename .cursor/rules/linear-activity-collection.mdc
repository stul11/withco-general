# Linear Activity Collection for Background Agent Testing

## Objective
Collect your Linear comments, mentions, and activity from today to use as realistic test cases for the background agent.

## Collection Process

### Step 1: Gather Linear Activity
Since I can't directly access your Linear workspace, please provide:

1. **Comments received today**:
   - Issue comments mentioning you
   - Project updates with your involvement
   - Discussion threads you're part of

2. **Mentions from today**:
   - @slittle mentions in issues
   - @slittle mentions in project updates
   - @slittle mentions in comments

3. **Activity from today**:
   - Issues assigned to you
   - Issues you commented on
   - Project updates you posted
   - Milestone changes affecting you

### Step 2: Format for Testing
For each item, provide:
- **Linear URL**: Link to the issue/project/comment
- **Context**: What the comment/mention is about
- **Action Required**: What you need to do
- **Priority**: High/Medium/Low
- **Due Date**: When it needs to be done

### Step 3: Test Case Creation
I'll convert each item into a background agent test case that demonstrates:
- Ticket wizard workflow
- Global To-Do project integration
- Safety rule compliance
- Work prioritization and management

## Sample Collection Format

### Comment/Mention 1
```
**Linear URL**: https://linear.app/withco/issue/LEG-XX/issue-title
**Context**: Comment about [topic] requiring [action]
**Action Required**: [Specific task]
**Priority**: High
**Due Date**: 2025-01-28
**Notes**: [Additional context]
```

### Comment/Mention 2
```
**Linear URL**: https://linear.app/withco/project/project-name
**Context**: Project update mentioning [topic]
**Action Required**: [Specific task]
**Priority**: Medium
**Due Date**: 2025-01-30
**Notes**: [Additional context]
```

## Background Agent Test Cases

Once you provide the Linear activity, I'll create test cases that demonstrate:

### 1. **Ticket Wizard Sessions**
- Convert each Linear item into a ticket wizard conversation
- Generate "Beautiful Ticket" outputs
- Create 3-tier DoD with binary checks
- Establish review and approval processes

### 2. **Global To-Do Integration**
- Create Linear issues in Global To-Do project
- Establish bidirectional sync
- Track progress and dependencies
- Maintain priority ordering

### 3. **Safety Validation**
- Ensure all operations target Global To-Do only
- Block any attempts to modify company Linear
- Maintain complete audit trail
- Validate safety rules work correctly

### 4. **Workflow Efficiency**
- Demonstrate time savings vs manual process
- Show context consistency across systems
- Validate dependency tracking
- Measure progress accuracy

## Expected Test Results

### ‚úÖ **Successful Operations**
- All Linear activity converted to ticket wizard sessions
- All work items added to Global To-Do project
- All safety rules enforced correctly
- All progress tracked accurately

### ‚ùå **Blocked Operations**
- No modifications to company Linear issues
- No unauthorized Linear operations
- No safety rule violations
- No context leakage between systems

### üìä **Performance Metrics**
- **Collection Time**: Reduced by X%
- **Context Consistency**: 100% maintained
- **Safety Violations**: 0 unauthorized operations
- **Work Management**: Improved efficiency

## Next Steps

1. **Provide Linear Activity**: Share your comments, mentions, and activity from today
2. **Review Collection**: I'll organize and prioritize the items
3. **Create Test Cases**: Convert each item into a background agent test
4. **Execute Tests**: Run the tests to demonstrate capabilities
5. **Validate Results**: Confirm safety and efficiency gains

## Ready to Collect

Please share your Linear activity from today, and I'll create comprehensive background agent test cases that demonstrate safe, efficient personal work management while protecting your company Linear projects.

**Format**: Use the sample collection format above, or provide the information in any format that's convenient for you.
