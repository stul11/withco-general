# Global NOTE File Naming

## Overview

To ensure consistent, searchable documentation, Session NOTEs must follow a single global filename convention,
regardless of where they are created or edited in the repository.

## Required Filename Patterns

- **Prefixes & patterns**:
  - Session NOTE: `SN_YYYYMMDD-HHMM_slug-with-dashes.md`
  - Meeting NOTE: `MN_YYYYMMDD-HHMM_slug-with-dashes.md`
  - Granola: `GR_YYYYMMDD-HHMM_slug-with-dashes.md`
  - Raw capture: `RN_YYYYMMDD-HHMM_slug-with-dashes.md`
- **Time basis**: 24-hour UTC; HHMM is the CREATED timestamp rounded down to the nearest 15 minutes (00, 15, 30, 45)
- **Slug**: kebab-case (lowercase letters, digits, and `-` only)
- **Immutability**: Filenames are immutable after creation; do not rename on subsequent edits
- **Recommended locations**:
  - `docs/agents/session-notes/` for `SN_`
  - `docs/meeting-notes/` (optional) for `MN_` or include within granola context
  - `docs/granola/` for `GR_`
  - `docs/raw/` (or `linear/{TEAM}/raw/` when team is known) for `RN_`

## Enforcement

Before creating or renaming NOTE files of these types:

- Confirm the filename matches the required pattern for the category
- Compute HHMM from the CREATED timestamp, rounded down to the nearest 15 minutes
- Keep `created` and `updated` fields in frontmatter per the Date/Time Format rule

If an existing or newly created file does not match, pause and rename it to the correct format, then update any links.

## Related Rules & Documents
