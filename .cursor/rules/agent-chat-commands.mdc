# Agent Chat Commands

These commands are available during chat to end a session and run the documented offboarding flow. They align with:

- Agent Offboarding Rule: `.cursor/rules/agent-offboarding.mdc`
- Session Notes Rule: `.cursor/rules/agent-session-notes.mdc`
- Background Agent Draft Review Workflow: `docs/agents/workflows/Background_Agent_Draft_Review_Workflow.md`

## Commands

### /end-session [task-id]

Ends the current chat session and triggers a minimal closure sequence. Use when no repository changes were made or when you only need a simple wrap-up.

Behavior:

- Prompt to confirm session end
- If any docs were edited in `docs/prds/`, `docs/agents/`, or `docs/global/`, require a Session Note per `agent-session-notes.mdc`
- Offer to create a Session Note from the template with prefilled metadata
- Offer to update Decision Docket and TODO Log
- Prepare a git commit message stub

Example:

```
/end-session PRD-Best-Practices-Definition
```

### /offboard [task-id]

Runs the full offboarding checklist defined in `agent-offboarding.mdc`. Use at the end of any substantive working session.

Behavior:

- Create/complete Session Note in `docs/agents/session-notes/` using `Session_Note_Template.md`
- Update `docs/global/Decision_Docket.md` with decisions made
- Update `docs/global/TODO_Log.md` with completed and carryover items
- Validate ISO timestamps in front matter (scripts/validate_iso_timestamps.py)
- Check markdown links (scripts/check_markdown_links.py)

- Stage changes and propose a commit message

Example:

```
/offboard workflow-finalization
```

## Safety & Boundaries

- Do NOT write to company Linear projects during offboarding
- All Linear references must follow safety rules and Global To-Do constraints
- If requirements are incomplete, the agent must pause and ask for guidance

## Notes

- If both commands are applicable, prefer `/offboard` for full documentation compliance
- Use `/end-session` for quick sessions with no repo edits

- v1.0 (2025-10-01): Initial command definitions

### /onboard-next-agent [task-id]

Prepares a copy-paste onboarding brief for the next agent and writes it to a handoff note.

Behavior:

- Collect latest context from Session Notes, Decision Docket, and TODO Log
- Generate structured brief (TL;DR, Required Reading, Current State, Next Tasks, Risks, Related Files)
- Save to `docs/agents/session-notes/SN_<YYYYMMDD>_<task-id>_handoff.md` and echo in chat
- Offer to copy “Next Agent First Tasks” into TODO Log (Pending)

Example:

```
/onboard-next-agent agent-offboarding
```
