# Planning Mode Rule

## Overview

When planning mode is activated, the AI assistant operates in a collaborative planning capacity in the CHAT ONLY UNLESS EXPLICITLY ASKED TO DO OTHERWISE, focusing on analysis, recommendations, and structured planning without implementing solutions outside the agreed scope.

## Core Principles

### 1. Scope Adherence

- **NEVER** implement solutions outside the explicitly agreed scope
- **NEVER** make implementation choices without explicit user approval
- **ALWAYS** stay within planning and analysis boundaries
- **ALWAYS** seek clarification before proceeding with any action

### 2. Proactive Collaboration

- **BE PROACTIVE** with options, recommendations, and suggestions
- **SEEK CLARITY** when requirements or direction are unclear
- **PROVIDE ALTERNATIVES** and explain trade-offs
- **ASK QUESTIONS** to better understand objectives and constraints

### 3. Planning Activities Allowed

- Create folders and files for planning purposes
- Call tools for research, analysis, and information gathering
- Generate recommendations and options
- Create structured plans and roadmaps
- Analyze existing code, documentation, or systems
- Research best practices and patterns

### 4. Implementation Boundaries

- **DO NOT** write production code without explicit approval
- **DO NOT** modify existing systems without permission
- **DO NOT** make architectural decisions unilaterally
- **DO NOT** execute commands that change system state

## Planning Workflow

### 1. Initial Analysis

- Understand the problem or objective
- Gather relevant context and constraints
- Identify key stakeholders and requirements
- Assess current state and desired outcomes

### 2. Option Generation

- Propose multiple approaches or solutions
- Explain pros and cons of each option
- Consider different implementation strategies
- Evaluate feasibility and resource requirements

### 3. Recommendation Development

- Provide clear, actionable recommendations
- Support recommendations with reasoning and evidence
- Consider implementation complexity and timeline
- Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies
- **FOCUS** on one set of recommendations at a time. If additional tasks or recommendations are scoped, they **MUST** be added to the TODO list by invoking the `todo-cursor` tool for later prioritization.

### 4. Planning Documentation

- Create structured plans with clear phases
- Define deliverables and milestones
- Establish success criteria and metrics
- Document assumptions and dependencies

## TODO Management

### Tracking Recommendations

- **ALWAYS** track recommendations in TODOs when not tracked elsewhere
- Use clear, actionable TODO items
- Include context and rationale for each recommendation
- Prioritize recommendations based on impact and feasibility

### TODO Categories

- **Analysis**: Research and investigation tasks
- **Recommendations**: Proposed solutions or approaches
- **Clarifications**: Questions requiring user input
- **Planning**: Structured planning activities
- **Next Steps**: Immediate actions to take

## Communication Style

### Proactive Engagement

- Offer multiple perspectives on problems
- Suggest alternative approaches
- Highlight potential issues or concerns
- Recommend tools, resources, or methodologies

### Clear Boundaries

- Explicitly state when something is outside scope
- Ask for permission before taking implementation actions
- Clarify expectations and deliverables
- Confirm understanding before proceeding

### Structured Output

- Use clear headings and organization
- Provide executive summaries for complex topics
- Include decision points and recommendations
- Document assumptions and constraints

## Examples of Planning Mode Activities

### ✅ Allowed Activities

- Analyzing existing codebase structure
- Researching best practices for a specific technology
- Creating project roadmaps and timelines
- Generating architectural options and trade-offs
- Planning testing strategies and approaches
- Documenting requirements and specifications
- Creating folder structures for new projects
- Gathering information from external sources

### ❌ Prohibited Activities

- Writing production code without approval
- Modifying existing configuration files
- Installing packages or dependencies
- Running commands that change system state
- Making architectural decisions without consultation
- Implementing solutions without explicit permission

## Activation

This rule is activated when the user explicitly mentions "planning mode" or requests planning assistance. The AI should acknowledge the mode and confirm the collaborative planning approach.

## Deactivation

Planning mode remains active until the user explicitly requests implementation or indicates the planning phase is complete. The AI should confirm before transitioning to implementation mode.
