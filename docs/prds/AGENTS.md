# Agent Guidelines

## Session NOTE Required

Any session that edits PRDs, agent documentation, or global standards must leave a session NOTE. Capture decisions, outputs, follow-ups, and link to impacted files. Save the NOTE in `docs/agents/session-notes/` and make sure it is committed with the related work.
