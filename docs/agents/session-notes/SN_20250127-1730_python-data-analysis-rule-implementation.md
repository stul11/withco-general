# Session NOTE

- **Task ID**: python-data-analysis-rule-implementation
- **Agent**: Claude Sonnet 4
- **Owner**: slittle
- **Date**: 2025-01-27T17:30:00Z
- **Duration**: ~5 minutes

---

## Inputs & Context

- **Key Documents/Files Provided**:
  - User provided Python data analysis cursor rule content
  - Existing cursor rule structure from `.cursor/rules/` directory
- **Context & Requirements**:
  - Add comprehensive Python data analysis guidelines to cursor workspace
  - Follow established rule naming convention and structure
  - Include best practices for pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, and Jupyter Notebooks
- **Relevant Prior Work**:
  - Existing cursor rules in `.cursor/rules/` directory
  - Established markdown formatting standards

---

## Full Findings

- **Summary of Findings**:
  - Successfully implemented comprehensive Python data analysis cursor rule
  - Rule follows established workspace conventions and structure
  - Covers all major aspects of Python data analysis workflow
- **Detailed Findings**:
  - **Description**: Created new cursor rule file for Python data analysis guidelines
  - **File(s) Involved**: `.cursor/rules/python-data-analysis.mdc`
  - **Line Numbers/Sections**: Entire file (new creation)
  - **Reasoning**: User requested addition of Python data analysis guidelines to cursor workspace, following established patterns
  - **Supporting Evidence**: Rule includes comprehensive coverage of pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, Jupyter Notebooks, error handling, performance optimization, and best practices

---

## Steps Taken

- **Major Actions**:
  - Created new cursor rule file at `.cursor/rules/python-data-analysis.mdc`
  - Structured content following established workspace conventions
  - Included comprehensive guidelines for Python data analysis workflow
- **Key Decisions**:
  - Used `.mdc` extension to match existing rule files
  - Structured content with clear sections and examples
  - Included practical code examples and best practices
- **Tools/Methods Used**:
  - File creation using write tool
  - Content structuring following template patterns

---

## Outputs

- **Files Created/Modified**:
  - `.cursor/rules/python-data-analysis.mdc` (new file with comprehensive Python data analysis guidelines)
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Complete Python data analysis cursor rule covering pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, and Jupyter Notebooks
  - Best practices for data manipulation, visualization, error handling, and performance optimization
  - Code examples and workflow patterns
- **Documented Decisions**:
  - Decision to implement Python data analysis guidelines as cursor rule
  - Decision to follow established workspace conventions and structure

---

## Citations

- `.cursor/rules/python-data-analysis.mdc` (entire file)
- User-provided Python data analysis rule content
- Existing cursor rule structure patterns

---

## Risks & Issues Identified

- **Potential Issues**:
  - None identified - straightforward implementation of user-provided content
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Rule follows established patterns and conventions
  - Content is comprehensive and well-structured

---

## Reasoning & Rationale

- Implemented the Python data analysis rule as requested by the user
- Followed established workspace conventions for cursor rules (`.mdc` extension, structured format)
- Structured content to be comprehensive yet readable, with practical examples
- Included all major aspects of Python data analysis workflow as specified in user requirements

---

## Next Actions

- **Immediate Follow-ups**:
  - [ ] Verify rule is properly integrated into cursor workspace
  - [ ] Test rule functionality if needed
- **For Next Session**:
  - [ ] Consider additional Python-specific rules if needed
  - [ ] Monitor usage and effectiveness of new rule
- **Pending Approvals/Decisions**:
  - [ ] User review of implemented rule
  - [ ] Confirmation that rule meets requirements
