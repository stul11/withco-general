## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Four-Phase Workflow

**Decision**: Implement 4-phase workflow (Draft → Review → Authorization → Implementation)

**Rationale**:

- Provides clear structure and checkpoints
- Ensures user oversight and quality control
- Integrates safety checks naturally
- Maintains efficiency while ensuring safety

**Impact**: All future background agent operations will follow this workflow

### Decision 2: User Authorization Required

**Decision**: Require explicit user authorization before creating Linear issues

**Rationale**:

- Prevents unauthorized Linear writes
- Ensures user oversight and approval
- Maintains safety compliance
- Gives user control over work items

**Impact**: Agent cannot create Linear issues without user approval

### Decision 3: File Organization Structure

**Decision**: Establish clear directory structure for drafts, WIP, and archived tickets

**Rationale**:

- Improves organization and discoverability
- Separates work stages clearly
- Facilitates workflow phases
- Enables easier cleanup and maintenance

**Impact**: All drafts will follow naming conventions and organization structure

### Decision 4: Safety Checks Integration

**Decision**: Integrate safety checks directly into workflow phases

**Rationale**:

- Prevents safety violations proactively
- Provides audit trail automatically
- Reduces risk of accidents
- Ensures compliance consistently

**Impact**: All Linear operations include mandatory safety checks

### Decision 5: Cross-Reference Pattern

**Decision**: Establish standard pattern for cross-referencing work across systems

**Rationale**:

- Maintains connections between related work
- Improves traceability
- Facilitates context gathering
- Supports both systems' purposes

**Impact**: All Linear issues created from drafts will include proper cross-references
