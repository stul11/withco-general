# Repository Cleanup Implementation Session

**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Duration**: ~45 minutes  
**Agent**: Background Agent  
**Task**: Implement high-priority cleanup items from TODO Log

## Summary

Successfully completed all 15 high-priority cleanup items identified in the repository analysis session. The repository is now clean, consistent, and properly organized with standardized templates, resolved naming conflicts, and eliminated stranded TODOs.

## Completed Work

### 1. Naming Consistency Resolution
- ✅ Renamed `GLB-TKT_Best_Practices.md` to `GBL-TKT_Best_Practices.md`
- ✅ Updated all references across repository files
- ✅ Established consistent GBL- prefix for global documents

### 2. Template Structure Cleanup
- ✅ Resolved duplicate ADR templates (kept canonical version in `docs/agents/templates/`)
- ✅ Resolved duplicate Research Request templates (kept canonical version in `docs/agents/templates/`)
- ✅ Removed overly nested directory structure (`docs/prds/global/templates/agents/adr/`)
- ✅ Standardized front matter across all templates

### 3. Content Completion
- ✅ Populated `docs/raw/cost-of-manufacturing-offering-context.md` with comprehensive business context
- ✅ Populated `docs/global/glossary/APPROVED-GLOSSARY.md` with key terms and definitions
- ✅ Verified `GBL-TKT_Best_Practices.md` was already complete (TODO item was incorrect)

### 4. Stranded TODO Cleanup
- ✅ Cleaned up stranded TODOs in RSM call notes files (marked as completed)
- ✅ Cleaned up stranded TODOs in LEG-63 work log (marked as completed)
- ✅ Left legitimate TODOs in SLF-78 draft ticket (represent actual work items)

### 5. File System Cleanup
- ✅ Removed obsolete files from `linear/tickets/archive/obsolete/`
- ✅ Removed empty `obsolete` directory
- ✅ Verified all referenced template files exist

### 6. Documentation Updates
- ✅ Updated Decision Docket with resolved decisions
- ✅ Updated TODO Log with completed cleanup items
- ✅ Maintained audit trail of all changes

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Template Location**: Established `docs/agents/templates/` as canonical location for agent-related templates
2. **Naming Convention**: Standardized on GBL- prefix for global documents
3. **Stranded TODOs**: Distinguished between cleanup TODOs (completed) and legitimate work TODOs (preserved)
4. **Directory Structure**: Simplified overly nested template directories
