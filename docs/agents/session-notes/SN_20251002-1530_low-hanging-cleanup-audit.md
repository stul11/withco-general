## Inputs & Context

- **Key Documents/Files Provided**:
  - `docs/global/TODO_Log.md`
  - `docs/global/TODO.codelens.todo`
  - `docs/indexes/renames-2025-10-02.md`
  - `docs/agents/session-notes/SN_20251002-1045_phase-02-sample-items.md`
  - `docs/agents/session-notes/SN_20251002-1056_phase-02-sample-items.md`
  - `docs/agents/session-notes/SN_20251002-1045_phase-02-command-docs-check.md`
  - `linear/tickets/drafts/standardized-vendor-list.md`
  - `docs/raw/plans/2025-10-02_document-categorization-and-workflows.md`
- **Context & Requirements**:
  - Review the repository for obvious cleanup opportunities focused on documentation consistency and workflows.
  - Capture actionable TODOs via `/TODO-add` format in the global backlog.
  - Leave a session note per global documentation editing guidelines.
- **Relevant Prior Work**:
  - Document taxonomy planning in `docs/raw/plans/2025-10-02_document-categorization-and-workflows.md`.
  - Existing backlog automation rules in `.cursor/rules/todo-cursor.mdc`.

## Full Findings

### F1 - TODO backlog sections still using checkbox syntax

- **Description**: `docs/global/TODO_Log.md` retains checkbox-style tasks under "Next Agent Session" and "Naming Conventions Rollout", preventing CodeLens triggers and violating the Option 3 schema.
- **File(s) Involved**: `docs/global/TODO_Log.md`
- **Reasoning**: These sections mix `- [ ]` entries and lack IDs/`TODO:` prefixes required by the CodeLens rule, so automation cannot track them.

### F2 - Phase 02 session notes missing template front matter

- **Description**: The `phase-02` session note placeholders are nearly empty and omit the required metadata front matter mandated by the Session NOTE template.
- **File(s) Involved**: `docs/agents/session-notes/SN_20251002-1045_phase-02-sample-items.md`, `docs/agents/session-notes/SN_20251002-1056_phase-02-sample-items.md`, `docs/agents/session-notes/SN_20251002-1045_phase-02-command-docs-check.md`
- **Reasoning**: Without front matter, downstream tooling cannot infer ownership or timestamps, and the documents do not meet AGENTS requirements.

### F3 - Linear drafts contain evergreen reference docs

- **Description**: `linear/tickets/drafts/standardized-vendor-list.md` is a structured cost reference, not a ticket draft, conflicting with the taxonomy plan that reserves `linear/` for active business planning.
- **File(s) Involved**: `linear/tickets/drafts/standardized-vendor-list.md`, `docs/raw/plans/2025-10-02_document-categorization-and-workflows.md`
- **Reasoning**: The taxonomy plan expects research/reference materials to live under `docs/raw/`; keeping them under `linear/` blurs draft tickets vs knowledge assets.

### F4 - Rename index still lists placeholder targets

- **Description**: `docs/indexes/renames-2025-10-02.md` includes rename targets such as `SN_20251001-0000_.md` that no longer exist, so the index is misleading.
- **File(s) Involved**: `docs/indexes/renames-2025-10-02.md`
- **Reasoning**: The index should reflect current filenames after the renaming sweep; stale entries confuse agents verifying migrations.

### F5 - CodeLens sidecar drifted from canonical backlog

- **Description**: `docs/global/TODO.codelens.todo` still lists duplicate or outdated backlog items (IDs 160-171) that do not mirror the Markdown log state.
- **File(s) Involved**: `docs/global/TODO.codelens.todo`
- **Reasoning**: The sidecar must stay in sync with `TODO_Log.md` to keep CodeLens actionable; stale entries indicate the generator or manual edits are out of date.

## Steps Taken

- Reviewed documentation directories (`docs/global`, `docs/agents`, `docs/indexes`, `linear/tickets/drafts`) for inconsistencies.
- Cataloged each cleanup opportunity with supporting evidence.
- Prepared backlog entries to capture remediation work.

---

## Outputs

- Drafted this session note summarizing findings.
- Identified five cleanup TODOs to append to the global backlog (pending commit).

## Risks & Issues Identified

- `TODO_Log.md` drift may block CodeLens-based automation until normalized.
- Session note placeholders risk failing future audits if left without metadata.
- Misplaced linear drafts create ambiguity about canonical storage locations.

---

## Reasoning & Rationale

- Prioritized issues that require minimal scope to resolve but unlock better automation or clarity.
- Focused on documentation consistency because it directly impacts agent workflows and tooling.

---

## Next Actions

- [ ] Append backlog items for F1â€“F5 in `docs/global/TODO_Log.md`
- [ ] Sync `docs/global/TODO.codelens.todo` alongside backlog additions
- [ ] Socialize findings with documentation maintainers (pending)
