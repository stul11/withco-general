# Session NOTE

- **Task ID**: phase-04-implementation-1
- **Agent**: gpt-5-codex
- **Owner**: slittle
- **Date**: 2025-10-02T13:00:00Z
- **Duration**: ~35m

---

## Inputs & Context

- **Key Documents/Files Provided**:
  - `docs/raw/plans/rollout/phase-04_adoption-and-qa.md`
  - `docs/raw/plans/2025-10-02_document-categorization-and-workflows.md`
  - `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
  - `.github/workflows/docs-qa.yml`
  - `docs/README.md`
  - `docs/global/README.md`
  - `docs/agents/templates/Session_Note_Template.md`
  - `docs/global/TODO_Log.md`
- **Context & Requirements**:
  - Execute Phase 04 adjustments: resolve pre-commit conflict, add CI checks (lint/links/timestamps/sidecar), document CodeLens sidecars, and ensure session NOTE checklist.
- **Relevant Prior Work**:
  - Sidecar approach defined and validated in prior session notes and plan; `/TODO-add` and rule updates already in place.

---

## Full Findings

- **Summary of Findings**:
  - Pre-commit had an unresolved merge conflict around the `sync-todo-codelens` hook; CI didn’t exist yet for docs QA; sidecar usage needed a contributor-facing note; session NOTE checklist missing.
- **Detailed Findings**:
  - **Description**: Merge conflict in pre-commit config prevented drift checks from running consistently.
  - **File(s) Involved**: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
  - **Reasoning**: Conflict markers present; sidecar check must run locally and in CI.
  - **Supporting Evidence**: Conflict markers at the bottom of local hooks block.

---

## Steps Taken

- **Major Actions**:
  - Resolved `.pre-commit-config.yaml` conflict and ensured `sync-todo-codelens` hook remains enabled.
  - Added CI workflow `docs-qa.yml` to run markdownlint, link check, ISO timestamp validation, and sidecar drift checks on PRs.
  - Added `docs/README.md` and updated `docs/global/README.md` with CodeLens sidecar usage guidance.
  - Added a “Session NOTE Checklist (Quick)” to `docs/agents/templates/Session_Note_Template.md`.
  - Added a new backlog item to `docs/global/TODO_Log.md` under General Backlog with `source:` and stable id.
- **Key Decisions**:
  - Mirror pre-commit sidecar drift enforcement in CI.
  - Defer team sidecar files until actionable items exist to avoid no-op surfaces.
- **Tools/Methods Used**:
  - File edits via repo tools; plan alignment against Phase 04 and taxonomy document.

---

## Outputs

- **Files Created/Modified**:
  - `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (merge conflict resolved; sidecar check kept)
  - `.github/workflows/docs-qa.yml` (new CI workflow)
  - `docs/README.md` (new quick-start + sidecar usage)
  - `docs/global/README.md` (sidecar usage note)
  - `docs/agents/templates/Session_Note_Template.md` (added quick checklist)
  - `docs/global/TODO_Log.md` (added Phase 04 follow-up backlog item)
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Working docs QA CI; consistent local and CI drift enforcement; clear contributor guidance.
- **Documented Decisions**:
  - Decision Docket updated to record CI adoption and Phase 04 adjustments.

## Risks & Issues Identified

- CI environment differences may reveal link/timestamp or sidecar drift issues not reproducible locally.
- Team sidecars are deferred; adoption steps should revisit once team TODOs accrue actionable entries.

---

## Reasoning & Rationale

- Enforcing identical checks in pre-commit and CI prevents drift and regressions while keeping the Markdown backlog canonical.
- Contributor-facing guidance reduces friction on CodeLens usage and session NOTE quality.

---

## Next Actions

- **Immediate Follow-ups**:
  - [ ] Monitor first CI run of `Docs QA` and address any failures.
  - [ ] Socialize CodeLens sidecar usage in contributor onboarding.
- **For Next Session**:
  - [ ] Sample 5 latest session NOTEs and record a brief compliance NOTE.
  - [ ] Consider adding a simple Cursor snippet to open sidecars alongside TODO logs.
- **Pending Approvals/Decisions**:
  - [ ] Confirm timing for executing taxonomy renames (Phase 03 → Phase 04 handoff).
