# Session NOTE

- **Task ID**: safety-alignment-review
- **Agent**: gpt-5-codex
- **Owner**: slittle
- **Date**: 2025-10-02T21:00:00Z
- **Duration**: ~60 min

---

## Plan

1. Review mandatory context (README, workflows, safety rules, plan) for guidance on Linear boundaries.
2. Compare safety expectations against contributor docs to spot conflicts or outdated instructions.
3. Capture risks, propose text diffs (without editing restricted files), and log follow-up TODOs.

---

## Findings & Risks

1. **Pip installation guidance conflicts with uv-only policy** – `scripts/README.md` still instructs contributors to run `pip install ...` even though `.cursor/rules/uv-guidelines.mdc` now mandates uv as the exclusive dependency manager. This risks agents reinstalling with pip and drifting from policy.
2. **`requirements.txt` encourages pip usage** – The file presents `pip install -r requirements.txt` as the canonical workflow despite the uv migration decision, creating ambiguity about whether the file is authoritative or legacy.
3. **Dependency duplication and Python 3.6 callout** – `scripts/README.md` claims Python 3.6 support and duplicates dependency notes already covered by uv planning, which may mislead agents about supported runtimes and mask the pending uv migration tasks.

-pip install pyyaml

+## Status
+
+> Managed by uv migration work. Generate from `uv lock` once the new workflow lands; avoid direct pip usage.
```

## TODO Updates

- Added new backlog items in `docs/global/TODO_Log.md` to track uv-compliant documentation updates and clarify dependency policies.
- Recommend running `python scripts/todos/sync_codelens.py` after merge to sync CodeLens sidecars.

---

## Approvals & Safety Notes

- No restricted files modified; only session note and TODO log updated per safety allowances.
- Proposed edits above require future approval before applying to the target files.

---

## Changelog

- Created this session note summarizing safety alignment review.
- Logged TODO follow-ups covering uv documentation remediation.
