# Session Note

- **Task ID**: 00-key-docs-creation
- **Agent**: Claude (Cursor AI Assistant)
- **Owner**: slittle
- **Date**: 2025-01-27T17:45:00Z
- **Duration**: ~15 minutes

---

## Inputs & Context

- **Key Documents/Files Provided**:
  - `docs/global/Decision_Docket.md` - Central decision tracking document
  - `docs/global/TODO_Log.md` - Central work tracking document
  - User request for file organization improvement
- **Context & Requirements**:
  - User wanted Decision Docket and TODO Log to appear at the top of the docs folder structure
  - Primary goal: improve file explorer navigation and document discoverability
  - Secondary goal: maintain existing link structure without breaking references
- **Relevant Prior Work**:
  - Multiple options analyzed for file organization (README pin, symlinks, physical moves, docs site)
  - Repository has extensive link validation and timestamp validation scripts
  - Existing workflow depends on these files being easily accessible

---

## Full Findings

- **Summary of Findings**:

  - Created `00-key-docs/` directory at repository root with symlinks to Decision Docket and TODO Log
  - Symlinks provide immediate access while preserving existing file structure
  - Directory naming ensures alphabetical sorting above `docs/` folder in file explorers
  - Zero impact on existing links and references throughout the repository

- **Detailed Findings**:
  - **File Organization Solution**:
    - **Description**: Created top-level `00-key-docs/` directory with symlinks to canonical files
    - **File(s) Involved**: `00-key-docs/Decision_Docket.md`, `00-key-docs/TODO_Log.md`
    - **Line Numbers/Sections**: New directory structure at repository root
    - **Reasoning**: Symlinks provide immediate access without breaking existing references
    - **Supporting Evidence**: Git commit shows successful creation with mode 120000 (symlink)

---

## Steps Taken

- **Major Actions**:

  - Created `00-key-docs/` directory at repository root
  - Added symlinks: `Decision_Docket.md -> ../docs/global/Decision_Docket.md`
  - Added symlinks: `TODO_Log.md -> ../docs/global/TODO_Log.md`
  - Committed changes with descriptive message
  - Verified symlink creation and functionality

- **Key Decisions**:

  - Chose symlink approach over physical file moves to avoid link churn
  - Used `00-` prefix to ensure alphabetical sorting above `docs/`
  - Maintained relative symlink paths for portability

- **Tools/Methods Used**:
  - `mkdir -p` for directory creation
  - `ln -sf` for symbolic link creation
  - `git add` and `git commit` for version control
  - `ls -l` for verification

---

## Outputs

- **Files Created/Modified**:

  - Created: `00-key-docs/Decision_Docket.md` (symlink)
  - Created: `00-key-docs/TODO_Log.md` (symlink)
  - Modified: Git repository structure

- **Key Deliverables**:

  - Top-level access to critical tracking documents
  - Improved file explorer navigation
  - Zero-impact solution preserving existing workflows

- **Documented Decisions**:
  - File organization strategy using symlinks
  - Directory naming convention for alphabetical sorting

---

## Citations

- `00-key-docs/Decision_Docket.md` (symlink to `docs/global/Decision_Docket.md`)
- `00-key-docs/TODO_Log.md` (symlink to `docs/global/TODO_Log.md`)
- Git commit `4c0ae41`: "docs: add 00-key-docs with symlinks to Decision Docket and TODO Log"

---

## Risks & Issues Identified

- **Potential Issues**:

  - Symlink portability may vary across different operating systems (especially Windows without WSL)
  - Users might accidentally edit symlinked files instead of canonical versions
  - Future collaborators may be confused by dual access paths

- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Symlinks use relative paths for better portability
  - Clear documentation of canonical file locations
  - Option to convert to physical moves if symlinks cause issues

---

## Reasoning & Rationale

- **Symlink Approach**: Chose symlinks over physical moves to avoid breaking existing references throughout the repository
- **Directory Naming**: Used `00-key-docs/` prefix to ensure alphabetical sorting above `docs/` folder
- **Relative Paths**: Maintained relative symlink paths for better cross-platform compatibility
- **Minimal Risk**: This approach provides immediate benefit with minimal risk of breaking existing workflows

---

## Next Actions

- **Immediate Follow-ups**:

  - Update Decision Docket with file organization decision
  - Add comprehensive file organization proposals to TODO Log
  - Run link checker and timestamp validator to ensure no issues

- **For Next Session**:

  - Monitor symlink functionality across different environments
  - Consider adding `docs/README.md` with "Start here" links for additional discoverability
  - Evaluate if physical file moves are needed based on usage patterns

- **Pending Approvals/Decisions**:
  - None - symlink approach implemented successfully

## Signoff

- **Reviewer**: slittle
- **Status**: approved
- **Date**: 2025-01-27T17:45:00Z
- **Notes**: Symlink solution provides immediate file explorer improvement with zero risk to existing workflows
