# Session NOTE

- **Task ID**: linear-documentation-v0
- **Agent**: background-docs-assistant
- **Owner**: slittle
- **Date**: 2025-10-02T21:00:00Z
- **Duration**: 2h

## Inputs & Context

- **Key Documents/Files Provided**:
  - `docs/raw/plans/2025-10-02_document-categorization-and-workflows.md`
  - `linear/global/raw/2025-01-27_data-ana-project-documentation-plan.md`
  - `docs/company/linear/How_to_use_Linear.md`
- **Context & Requirements**:
  - Create standardized ANA/DATA project documentation structure; move templates to `@raw/templates/`.
  - Incorporate Maureen’s CTO requirements; add ANA-focused plan; create example docs.
  - Add a reusable project glossary grouped by meaning; compile analytics resources from Notion.
- **Relevant Prior Work**:
  - Prior edits added CTO requirements and ANA plan; this session focuses on examples, glossary template, capabilities capture, and Notion index.

---

## Full Findings

- **Summary of Findings**:
  - A single example template and a separate glossary template improve consistency across ANA/DATA projects.
  - ANA capabilities from Linear doc consolidated into repo for offline reference.
  - Notion analytics items are dispersed; a grouped index enables triage and consolidation.
- **Detailed Findings**:
  - **Description**: Project documentation example required brackets to signal placeholders; moved and referenced by filename in ANA/DATA plan.
    - **File(s) Involved**: `linear/global/raw/templates/project-documentation-example.md`
    - **Line Numbers/Sections**: L1-L269
    - **Reasoning**: Centralizing the example avoids duplication in planning docs.
    - **Supporting Evidence**: Plan now references example by filename only.
  - **Description**: Glossary should be grouped by meaning/domains rather than alphabetical; created project glossary example template.
    - **File(s) Involved**: `linear/global/raw/templates/project-glossary-example.md`
    - **Line Numbers/Sections**: L1-L150
    - **Reasoning**: Improves discoverability and team alignment on terminology.
    - **Supporting Evidence**: Usage section instructs domain grouping and cross-linking.
  - **Description**: Captured analytics capabilities from Linear document into repo as 2024 snapshot.
    - **File(s) Involved**: `linear/ANA/raw/2024-analytics-capabilities.md`
    - **Line Numbers/Sections**: L34-L167
    - **Reasoning**: Ensures offline access and structured grouping by category.
    - **Supporting Evidence**: Capabilities matrix and grouped categories included.
  - **Description**: Indexed Notion analytics pages by relevancy tier for ANA triage.
    - **File(s) Involved**: `linear/ANA/raw/notion-all-ANA.md`
    - **Line Numbers/Sections**: L1-L145
    - **Reasoning**: Provides a single place to review and decide KEEP/REFINE/ARCHIVE.
    - **Supporting Evidence**: Tiered list with links to Notion pages.

## Steps Taken

- **Major Actions**:
  - Created `project-documentation-example.md` and added brackets for placeholders.
  - Created `project-glossary-example.md` grouped by domain; updated usage guidance.
  - Updated ANA/DATA plan to reference example by filename and add glossary to folder structure.
  - Created `2024-analytics-capabilities.md` from Linear doc.
  - Searched Notion for analytics items and created `notion-all-ANA.md` with relevancy tiers.
- **Key Decisions**:
  - Use single example doc and glossary template for all ANA/DATA projects.
  - Centralize ANA capabilities snapshot in repo under `linear/ANA/raw/`.
  - Use tiered relevancy for Notion aggregation before triage.
- **Tools/Methods Used**:
  - Repo edits via editor; Notion and Linear MCP lookups; link and timestamp validation planned per offboarding.

## Risks & Issues Identified

- **Potential Issues**:
  - Link drift between templates and planning docs.
  - Notion pages may change; local index can become stale.
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Keep references by filename only in plans; schedule periodic refresh of Notion index.

---

## Reasoning & Rationale

- Consolidating examples reduces duplication and enforces standards.
- Grouped glossary improves comprehension and cross-team alignment.
- Local copy of capabilities and Notion index accelerates triage and execution.

## Next Actions

- **Immediate Follow-ups**:
  - [ ] Triage Tier 1 items in `notion-all-ANA.md` (KEEP/REFINE/ARCHIVE)
  - [ ] Apply example/glossary templates to at least one active ANA project
- **For Next Session**:
  - [ ] Add review cadence to capabilities doc; fill TBU sections
  - [ ] Backfill links in ANA plan to specific Notion pages
- **Pending Approvals/Decisions**:
  - [ ] Confirm glossary group taxonomy
  - [ ] Approve ANA Tier 1 triage outcomes
