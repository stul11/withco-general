# Session NOTE

- **Task ID**: todo-codelens-open-review
- **Agent**: gpt-5-codex
- **Owner**: slittle
- **Date**: 2025-10-02T16:52:00Z
- **Duration**: ~45 min

## Inputs & Context

- `docs/global/TODO.codelens.todo`
- `docs/global/TODO_Log.md`
- `docs/agents/session-notes/SN_20251001-0000_workflow-finalization.md`
- `docs/agents/session-notes/SN_20251002-1300_phase-04-implementation-1.md`
- `docs/agents/session-notes/SN_20250127-2030_markdownlint-implementation.md`
- `docs/agents/session-notes/SN_20250127-2030_markdownlint-phase2-3-implementation.md`

## Full Findings

- Confirmed five operational TODOs were already delivered during prior sessions:
  - Background Agent workflow review and Ticket Wizard alignment were completed by the user during the 2025-10-01 workflow-finalization session.
  - The docs quick-start page launched as part of the Phase 04 adoption work.
  - Markdown linting deliverables (cursor rules, VS Code settings, staged fixes, and CI integration) shipped in the January 27 markdownlint rollout.
- Remaining open entries fall into four buckets that still need action:
  1. **uv migration** (IDs 116-121) ‚Äì repository lacks `pyproject.toml`, uv lockfile, quickstart, and CI policy.
  2. **Workflow adoption** (IDs 124-130) ‚Äì testing the background agent workflow, automation, and feedback loops is still pending.
  3. **Documentation build-out** (IDs 131-155, 201, 401-405) ‚Äì new PRDs, agent taxonomy, backlog hygiene, and note naming work not yet started.
  4. **Command validation** (IDs 156, 159, 207, 208) ‚Äì required dry-runs and alignment tasks remain outstanding.
- Large ‚Äúfuture feature‚Äù ideas (IDs 164-178) have no recorded implementation; they continue to serve as planning placeholders.

## Steps Taken

- Parsed every `[Open]` entry in `TODO.codelens.todo` and grouped them by theme.
- Cross-referenced each candidate with session notes, repository files, and existing documentation to verify completion status.
- Updated `TODO.codelens.todo` and the canonical TODO log where prior work already satisfied the requirement.
- Logged this audit and supporting evidence in a new session note for traceability.

## Outputs

- **Closed TODO Items**:
  - `TODO-Log-122` ‚Äì Verified approval captured in `SN_20251001-0000_workflow-finalization.md:510-515`.
  - `TODO-Log-123` ‚Äì Same session note confirmed documentation review complete.
  - `TODO-Log-143` ‚Äì Documented creation of `docs/README.md` in `SN_20251002-1300_phase-04-implementation-1.md:60-82`.
  - `TODO-Log-160` & `TODO-Log-161` ‚Äì Markdown cursor rules and VS Code settings delivered per `SN_20250127-2030_markdownlint-implementation.md:80-118`.
  - `TODO-Log-162` & `TODO-Log-163` ‚Äì Staged fixes and CI workflow recorded in `SN_20250127-2030_markdownlint-phase2-3-implementation.md:77-108`.
- **Files Updated**:
  - `docs/global/TODO.codelens.todo` ‚Äì marked completed items as `[Done]`.
  - `docs/global/TODO_Log.md` ‚Äì checkboxes flipped to `[x]` in General Backlog and Phase 2 plan.
  - `docs/agents/session-notes/SN_20251002-1652_todo-codelens-open-review.md` ‚Äì new audit log (this document).

## Risks & Issues

- uv migration backlog (IDs 116-121) lacks an owner; repo still depends on `requirements.txt` and `pip` guidance.
- Workflow validation tasks (IDs 124-130, 156, 159) block confidence in the background agent process‚Äîdry-runs and automation remain untested.
- Documentation expansion (IDs 131-155, 201, 401-405) represents significant content debt; without prioritization, backlog drift will continue.
- Future enhancements (IDs 164-178) are aspirational; consider demoting to a parking lot so the active backlog remains actionable.

---

## Next Actions

1. Assign ownership and schedule work for the uv migration cluster (IDs 116-121).
2. Plan a dedicated session to execute the outstanding workflow dry-runs (IDs 124-130, 156, 159, 207, 208).
3. Decide whether to keep the speculative markdown enhancements (IDs 164-178) in the active backlog or archive them into a separate roadmap document.

## Agent Sign-off

- ‚úÖ Audit complete; historical deliverables reconciled with active backlog.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è High-effort clusters remain open (uv migration, workflow validation, documentation build-out).
- üìå See ‚ÄúNext Actions‚Äù for recommended sequencing.
