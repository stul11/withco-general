# Agent Template Automation

This directory is covered by the generated `AGENTS.md` guardrails. The
`AGENTS.md` files are produced from the rules stored under `.cursor/rules/`
so that updates to the Cursor workspace automatically propagate to the
repository.

## Folder expectations

- Contains the canonical templates used by agents to author recurring artifacts (playbooks, context packs, decision logs, checklists, etc.).
- Templates live at the top level as Markdown files; no nested folders are expected after the retired `ADR/` subtree. Add `example-*` files only when a template needs a worked example.
- Name reusable templates with the `_Template` suffix (for example, `Playbook_Template.md`) so they are easy to discover via search.
- Include the standard metadata header (`id`, `title`, `version`, `created`, `updated`, `owner`, `status`, `tags`) before the horizontal rule. That block keeps agent automation in sync and enables downstream tooling.
- Keep generated guardrails (`AGENTS.md`) and hand-authored documentation (`README.md`) under version control; do not edit generated files manually.

## Taxonomy

- **Core agent docs**: `Agent_Role_Card_Template.md`, `Context_Pack_Template.md`, `Playbook_Template.md`, and `Session_Note_Template.md` capture the primary operating artifacts for agents.
- **Process trackers**: `Decision_Docket_Template.md`, `TODO_Log_Template.md`, and `Research_Request_Template.md` provide structured logs for in-flight work and should be used when recording decisions or research tasks.
- **Lifecycle checklists**: `Onboarding_Checklist_Template.md` and `Offboarding_Checklist_Template.md` govern human-to-agent handovers.
- **Specialized utilities**: Files such as `Granola_Paste_Template.md` and `background-clean-up-template.md` support niche workflows; keep similar helpers nearby so automation can surface them together.
- **Historical references**: `ADR_Template.md` and `example-adr.md` replace the removed `ADR/` directoryâ€”store any future ADR material here as templates or examples rather than in a nested folder.

## Syncing rule templates

Run the sync script whenever you make changes to the `.cursor/rules`
front-matter or when you add new directories that should inherit the
instructions.

```bash
python scripts/sync_agents_rules.py
```

The script parses each rule's `globs` configuration, renders the appropriate
Markdown snippet, and writes or updates the `AGENTS.md` files it manages. It
also removes previously generated files whose directories are no longer
covered by any rule.

## Pre-commit integration

The pre-commit configuration executes the sync script in check mode:

```bash
python scripts/sync_agents_rules.py --check
```

If the generated files are out of date the hook will fail, prompting you to
run the script in write mode and commit the results.

## Reviewing generated files

All generated files include a banner:

```text
<!-- Generated by scripts/sync_agents_rules.py; do not edit manually. -->
```

Do not edit these files by hand. Instead, update the relevant `.cursor/rules`
content and re-run the sync script.
