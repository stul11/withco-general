# Agent Template Automation

This directory is covered by the generated `AGENTS.md` guardrails. The
`AGENTS.md` files are produced from the rules stored under `.cursor/rules/`
so that updates to the Cursor workspace automatically propagate to the
repository.

## Syncing rule templates

Run the sync script whenever you make changes to the `.cursor/rules`
front-matter or when you add new directories that should inherit the
instructions.

```bash
python scripts/sync_agents_rules.py
```

The script parses each rule's `globs` configuration, renders the appropriate
Markdown snippet, and writes or updates the `AGENTS.md` files it manages. It
also removes previously generated files whose directories are no longer
covered by any rule.

## Pre-commit integration

The pre-commit configuration executes the sync script in check mode:

```bash
python scripts/sync_agents_rules.py --check
```

If the generated files are out of date the hook will fail, prompting you to
run the script in write mode and commit the results.

## Reviewing generated files

All generated files include a banner:

```text
<!-- Generated by scripts/sync_agents_rules.py; do not edit manually. -->
```

Do not edit these files by hand. Instead, update the relevant `.cursor/rules`
content and re-run the sync script.
