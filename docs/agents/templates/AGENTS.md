# Agent Guidelines

## Agent Artifacts Standard

Ensure every agent artifact stays aligned with the core template. When editing role cards,
context packs, playbooks, or checklists, confirm the document includes the required sections:
Purpose & Scope, Inputs & Outputs, Constraints & Safety, Success Criteria, Ownership &
Escalation, Context Packs, Playbooks, and Version History. Reference the canonical templates
in `docs/agents/templates/` and keep checklists of required sections up to date when
publishing changes.

## Session NOTE Required

Any session that edits PRDs, agent documentation, or global standards must leave a session
NOTE. Capture decisions, outputs, follow-ups, and link to impacted files. Save the NOTE in
`docs/agents/session-notes/` and make sure it is committed with the related work.
