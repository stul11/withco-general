**Content**:

- Meeting notes and call summaries
- Key decisions and insights
- Context and background information
- Reference materials and precedents
- Historical work documentation

**Usage**:

- Documentation and reference
- Context gathering for new work
- Decision tracking and rationale
- Knowledge management

### To-Do & Planning Project

**Purpose**: Global planning and work tracking
**Content**:

- Active work items and tasks
- Planning and prioritization
- Progress tracking and status
- Action items and next steps
- Work item organization

**Usage**:

- Action-oriented work management
- Planning and prioritization
- Progress tracking
- Task execution and completion

## Decision Framework for Work Item Placement

### Place in SLF-73 (Global Work Log) when

- ✅ **Meeting notes** and call summaries
- ✅ **Key decisions** and rationale
- ✅ **Context and background** information
- ✅ **Reference materials** and precedents
- ✅ **Historical documentation**
- ✅ **Insights and learnings**

### Place in To-Do & Planning Project when

- ✅ **Active work items** and tasks
- ✅ **Planning and prioritization**
- ✅ **Progress tracking** and status
- ✅ **Action items** and next steps
- ✅ **Work item organization**
- ✅ **Task execution** and completion

### Cross-Reference when

- ✅ **Work items** reference context from SLF-73
- ✅ **Decisions** in SLF-73 lead to work items in To-Do
- ✅ **Progress** in To-Do updates context in SLF-73
- ✅ **Insights** from work inform decisions in SLF-73

### Document Management Process

For detailed meeting notes and context:

1. **Create documents in To-Do & Planning project** for detailed content
2. **Reference documents in SLF-73** with summary and purpose
3. **Use proper Linear formatting** for all issue references (e.g., `SLF-74` not markdown links)
4. **Use markdown links for document references** (e.g., `[📞 RSM CALL NOTES - SEPTEMBER 30, 2025](https://linear.app/withco/document/...)`)
5. **Update project descriptions** to include document references with summaries

### Cross-Reference Pattern

When creating Linear issue from draft:

1. **Add context reference** to SLF-73 in Linear issue description using proper Linear formatting (e.g., `SLF-73`)
2. **Update SLF-73** with link to new Linear issue using proper Linear formatting
3. **Archive draft** with Linear issue link in front matter
4. **Cross-link** related work items using proper Linear formatting

## Current Overlap Areas

### Identified Overlaps

1. **RSM call notes** - Currently documented in both systems
2. **Work item tracking** - Some items appear in both places
3. **Progress updates** - Updates happening in both systems
4. **Decision tracking** - Decisions tracked in both places

### Resolution Strategy

1. **RSM call notes** - Create document in To-Do & Planning, reference with summary in SLF-73
2. **Work item tracking** - Primary in To-Do, context in SLF-73
3. **Progress updates** - Primary in To-Do, summary in SLF-73
4. **Decision tracking** - Primary in SLF-73, action items in To-Do
5. **Detailed meeting notes** - Documents in To-Do & Planning, summaries in SLF-73

---

## Sync Mechanisms

### Manual Sync Process

1. **Weekly review** of both systems
2. **Cross-reference** work items and context
3. **Update** relevant information in both systems
4. **Maintain** consistency between systems

### Automated Sync (Future)

1. **Background agent** monitors both systems
2. **Automatic cross-referencing** of related items
3. **Consistency checks** and alerts
4. **Progress updates** sync between systems

---

## Guidelines for Work Item Placement

### New Work Item Process

1. **Assess** work item type (context vs action)
2. **Place** in appropriate system based on purpose
3. **Cross-reference** in other system if needed
4. **Update** both systems as work progresses

### Content Migration Process

1. **Identify** content that's in wrong system
2. **Move** content to appropriate system
3. **Cross-reference** in original system
4. **Update** any dependent work items

### Maintenance Process

1. **Regular review** of both systems
2. **Clean up** duplicate or outdated content
3. **Ensure** cross-references are current
4. **Monitor** process effectiveness

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Define Process (Today)

- [x] Define system purposes
- [x] Create decision framework
- [x] Document current overlap
- [x] Create process outline

### Phase 2: Implement Process (This Week)

- [ ] Apply process to current work items
- [ ] Migrate content to appropriate systems
- [ ] Create cross-references
- [ ] Test process effectiveness

### Phase 3: Refine Process (Next Week)

- [ ] Monitor process usage
- [ ] Gather feedback and insights
- [ ] Refine guidelines and procedures
- [ ] Create automation opportunities

### Phase 4: Optimize Process (Ongoing)

- [ ] Implement automation where possible
- [ ] Monitor process effectiveness
- [ ] Continuously improve process
- [ ] Scale process across all work
