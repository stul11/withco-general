## Informal Glossary Workflow

> Working space for capturing candidate terminology before it is promoted into the [Approved Glossary](./APPROVED-GLOSSARY.md).

## Purpose

The informal glossary holds **draft** definitions, feedback, and supporting references while a term is under review. It ensures we have a single canonical list (the approved glossary) while still giving contributors a lightweight place to propose or refine language.

## Promotion Steps

1. **Propose** a term in the working queue table below. Include a concise draft definition, links to source material, and who is sponsoring the addition.
2. **Review & Iterate** by tagging stakeholders or adding review notes in the `Feedback / Next Action` column. Clarify outstanding questions before promotion.
3. **Decision**:
   - When approved, move the definition into `APPROVED-GLOSSARY.md`, update the queue row status to `Approved`, and link to the canonical entry.
   - If rejected or deprioritized, update the status accordingly and capture rationale.
4. **Clean Up** after promotion by archiving resolved comments and ensuring the approved glossary version is incremented as part of the pull request.

## Working Terms Queue

| Term                                                 | Draft Definition | Status | Feedback / Next Action | Owner | Linkage |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------ | ---------------------- | ----- | ------- |
| _(add new rows below this line as proposals arrive)_ |                  |        |                        |       |         |

## Tips for Contributors

- Keep draft definitions short (1â€“2 sentences) and avoid duplicating content from the approved glossary.
- Use the `Linkage` column to reference Linear issues, docs, or meeting notes that justify the term.
- If a term affects multiple teams, tag representatives in the pull request and record their sign-off in the queue.
