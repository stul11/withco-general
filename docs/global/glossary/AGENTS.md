# Agent Guidelines

## Session Note Required

Any session that edits PRDs, agent documentation, or global standards must leave a session note. Capture decisions, outputs, follow-ups, and link to impacted files. Save the note in `docs/agents/session-notes/` and make sure it is committed with the related work.
