**REIT issuer (Delaware LLC)**

Retail Investors: Common interests representing the principal amount invested, plus a targeted distribution of \[8\]% (distributed on a semi-annual basis) that accrues if unpaid, and with residual upside upon liquidation.

**Operating Partnership**

Securities:

1. SMB Profits Interests: SMB profit interests representing up to 80% of the upside upon liquidation. The SMB’s right to the upside will vest over the life of the lease, in 6 month increments, subject to forfeiture if not in compliance with their lease obligations (e.g., if there is a default).

2. Withco Profits Interests: Management profit interests representing 20% of the upside upon liquidation.

3. OP Units: OP Units (for a potential property seller) that are convertible into REIT common interests after the \[one-year\] anniversary of issuance and at the option of the holder.

Distribution Upon LiquidationOP Waterfall: Distributions upon a liquidating event should be as follows:

1. Return of Principal: Return of 100% of the principal invested to the Common Interest Holders and OP Unit Holders, as applicable, pro rata in proportion to the number of Common Interests and OP Units held by such holders, paid per Common Interest, and OP Unit, until the aggregate distributions paid per Common Interest and OP Unit equals $\[Principal Invested/Contributed\].

2. Return of Accrued but Unpaid Target Returns: In the event that any funds remain available, the amount of the accrued but unpaid target distributions to Common Interest Holders shall be paid to such holders on a pro rata basis.

   _Note to Carmen_: When you discussed yesterday how the Common Interest holders would have last priority, I think this was in the context that there might be fees paid to withco and the SMB tenant upon liquidation. Since we are now following the profit interests model, I understand that this payout to the retail investors of principal/dividends first should be okay, but let me know if I’m misunderstanding anything.

3. Upside Allocation: In the event that any funds remain available for distribution, the upside will be split among Withco (20%) and SMB (80%) according to their profit interests.

4. Residual Upside: In the event that any funds remain available (e.g., if SMB forfeits a portion of their 80% upside), the remaining funds should be distributed to the Common Interest Holders and OP Unit holders, as applicable.
