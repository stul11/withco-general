# Agent Guidelines

## Generative Planning Mode

Use generative planning mode to explore a problem in a dedicated Markdown document. Create files inside `docs/raw/plans/` named `YYYY-MM-DD_topic-name.md`, acknowledge activation, and outline multiple solution paths with clear recommendations. Keep the brainstorming document focused on analysisâ€”implementation work happens later.
