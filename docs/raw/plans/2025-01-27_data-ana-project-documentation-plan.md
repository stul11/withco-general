# DATA/ANA Project Documentation Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines a comprehensive approach to create additional documentation and context for all DATA and ANA Projects that are not yet completed and are tied to the "10/27 super initiative" (or similar timeline-based initiatives). The goal is to establish a standardized documentation framework that captures project context, historical work, and resources for better project management and knowledge retention.

### 10/27 Super Initiative Context

While specific references to a "10/27 super initiative" were not found in the current Linear data, several projects have target dates around October 2025, suggesting a coordinated timeline. The super initiative concept aligns with Linear's definition: "a specific timeline around which we rally large streams of work."

## Proposed Documentation Framework

### 1. Standardized Project Document Form

Each project will have a comprehensive markdown document following this structure:

```markdown
---

title: [Project Name] - Project Documentation
status: [Draft/In Progress/Completed]
stage: [Planning/Development/Testing/Deployment]
owner: [Project Lead]
people: [Team Members]
reviewers: [Stakeholders]
approver: [Approver]
priority: [High/Medium/Low]
tags: [relevant-tags]

team: [DATA/ANA]
super_initiative: "[Super Initiative Name]"

### 2. Folder Structure

For each identified project, create the following folder structure:

```
linear/DATA/projects/[project-name]/
├── README.md (Project overview document)
├── docs/
│   ├── requirements.md
│   ├── architecture.md
│   ├── decisions.md
│   └── resources.md
├── raw/
│   ├── research/
│   ├── notes/
│   └── external-links.md
└── archive/
    └── [completed-work]

linear/ANA/projects/[project-name]/
├── README.md (Project overview document)
├── docs/
│   ├── requirements.md
│   ├── architecture.md
│   ├── decisions.md
│   └── resources.md
├── raw/
│   ├── research/
│   ├── notes/
│   └── external-links.md
└── archive/
    └── [completed-work]
```

## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Project Identification & Prioritization (Week 1)

1. **Confirm 10/27 Super Initiative Scope**

   - Search Linear for specific super initiative references
   - Identify all projects with October 2025 target dates
   - Validate project status and completion criteria

2. **Create Project Inventory**
   - List all DATA/ANA projects not marked as "Completed" or "Canceled"
   - Prioritize based on target dates and business impact
   - Identify cross-team dependencies

### Phase 2: Document Template Development (Week 1-2)

1. **Design Standardized Form**

   - Create the markdown template (as shown above)
   - Define required vs. optional sections
   - Establish naming conventions

2. **Create Folder Structure**
   - Set up project folders for each identified project
   - Create initial README.md files
   - Establish raw capture directories

### Phase 3: Historical Work Collection (Week 2-3)

1. **Linear Integration**

   - Use Linear MCP to gather all related issues
   - Extract project descriptions, milestones, and requirements
   - Capture decision history and comments

2. **External Resource Gathering**

   - Search Google Drive for project-related documents
   - Identify research materials and external links
   - Document code repositories and technical resources

3. **Context Documentation**
   - Interview project leads for additional context
   - Document lessons learned from previous iterations
   - Capture business rationale and success criteria

### Phase 4: Document Creation & Review (Week 3-4)

1. **Initial Document Creation**

   - Populate template for each project
   - Fill in available information from Linear and external sources
   - Identify gaps requiring additional research

2. **Review & Validation**
   - Project lead review of initial documentation
   - Stakeholder feedback and corrections
   - Final approval and publication

### Phase 5: Maintenance & Updates (Ongoing)

1. **Regular Updates**

   - Weekly status updates during active development
   - Decision log maintenance
   - Resource link validation

2. **Archive Management**
   - Move completed work to archive folders
   - Update project status and lessons learned
   - Maintain historical context for future iterations

## Success Criteria

### Immediate Goals (4 weeks)

- [ ] All identified DATA/ANA projects have standardized documentation
- [ ] Project folders created with proper structure
- [ ] Historical work captured and organized
- [ ] External resources documented and linked

### Long-term Goals (3 months)

- [ ] Documentation framework adopted across all teams
- [ ] Regular maintenance process established
- [ ] Knowledge retention improved for project transitions
- [ ] Template refined based on usage feedback

## Resource Requirements

### Time Estimates

- **Project Identification**: 4 hours
- **Template Development**: 8 hours
- **Historical Collection**: 16 hours (2 hours per project)
- **Document Creation**: 20 hours (2.5 hours per project)
- **Review & Refinement**: 12 hours
- **Total**: ~60 hours over 4 weeks

### Team Involvement

- **Project Leads**: 2 hours per project for review and context
- **Stakeholders**: 1 hour per project for feedback
- **Documentation Owner**: Primary responsibility for execution

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks

1. **Incomplete Historical Context**: Some projects may lack detailed history

   - _Mitigation_: Focus on available information, note gaps for future research

2. **Resource Access**: Limited access to external systems (Google Drive, etc.)

   - _Mitigation_: Work with project leads to gather external resources

3. **Timeline Pressure**: October 2025 deadlines may create urgency

   - _Mitigation_: Prioritize projects by target date and business impact

4. **Template Adoption**: Teams may resist standardized documentation
   - _Mitigation_: Involve teams in template design, emphasize benefits

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. **Confirm Super Initiative Details**

   - Search Linear for "10/27" or "October 27" references
   - Identify specific projects tied to this timeline
   - Validate project status and completion criteria

2. **Create Initial Project List**

   - Compile definitive list of DATA/ANA projects requiring documentation
   - Prioritize based on target dates and business impact
   - Assign project leads and stakeholders

3. **Begin Template Development**
   - Create first draft of standardized markdown form
   - Test with one pilot project
   - Gather initial feedback for refinement

### Week 2 Actions

1. **Finalize Documentation Template**
2. **Create Project Folder Structure**
3. **Begin Historical Work Collection**

### Week 3 Actions

1. **Complete Historical Collection**
2. **Start Document Creation**
3. **Begin Review Process**

### Week 4 Actions

1. **Complete Document Creation**
2. **Finalize Review Process**
3. **Establish Maintenance Procedures**

## Conclusion

This plan provides a comprehensive framework for documenting DATA and ANA projects tied to the 10/27 super initiative (or similar timeline-based initiatives). The standardized approach will improve project visibility, knowledge retention, and team coordination while establishing a foundation for future project documentation efforts.

The key to success will be maintaining focus on the most critical projects first, ensuring stakeholder buy-in, and establishing sustainable maintenance processes that can scale across the organization.
