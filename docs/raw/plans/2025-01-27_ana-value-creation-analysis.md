## Plan: ANA Value Creation Analysis Framework

### Executive Summary

Develop a comprehensive framework for ANA (Analytics) team projects that analyzes value creation from two critical angles: (1) "What data do we need to create value?" and (2) "What value do we need to create for users?" This framework will ensure all ANA projects align with Maureen's CTO requirements while maintaining focus on data-driven value delivery.

### Maureen's CTO Requirements (ANA-Specific)

All ANA project documentation must include:

- **Explicit value creation first**: State the primary value(s) the analytics project delivers (e.g., "Risk assessment accuracy from 70% to 95%", "Deal evaluation time from 4 hours to 30 minutes")
- **Clear definition of done tied to value**: What must be true at launch to achieve that value (not just "dashboard exists")
- **Success metrics/specs**: Accuracy, coverage, confidence, consistency, speed/latency, ease-of-use/ops touchpoints
- **User/consumer focus**: Who consumes the analytics output (SMB, investor, internal ops) and how it improves their flow
- **Near-term scope vs later**: What's in V1 vs V2 to hit the 10/27 milestone
- **Operational hooks**: Tools/UX needed for humans to correct/update analytics outputs if time-saving is the goal
- **Dependencies and milestones**: Phased steps with dates to track progress company-wide (milestones show up on a Gantt)

- **Timeliness**: How fresh must the data be for value creation?
- **Consistency**: What consistency standards must be maintained?

#### Data Sources & Integration

- **Primary Sources**: Which data sources are critical for value creation?
- **Secondary Sources**: Which sources provide supporting context?
- **Integration Points**: How do data sources connect to create value?
- **Data Dependencies**: What external data dependencies exist?

#### Data Processing Requirements

- **Transformation Needs**: What data transformations are required?
- **Aggregation Requirements**: What level of aggregation creates value?
