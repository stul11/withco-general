I want to work with you to clarify, plan, stress test, research, improve, and execute on analyzing the economics of the company I'm building. We are launching a verticalized small balance commercial real estate purchase, investment and capital network, where we use technology to launch offerings and purchase property through Reg A crowdfunding platform. Arrived.com has a similar platform for investors, but is in SFR. We purchase the property in alignment with small businesses, and put them on an innovative financial product where they get to participate in the ownership of the property, monetize over time, and have choices as it relates to the fundraise terms they seek.
I need to map out the unit, platform costs across a complicated and broad set of providers we'll use to run and scale and monetize the platform. I need to make decisions across legal counsel and setup, technology, regulatory, tax, transaction, etc. I have many bits and pieces of this together, but am working on a definitive proposal outlining the economics of our company, our financial product with SMBs, and investor returns.
My notes are below. I want to start rigorously organizing these throughts into a formalized plan for presenting the economics of our business as we kick off on this ambitious project. I have information across many excel documents, contracts, emails, linear, notion, etc. that I need to clean up as part of my final workproduct.
Review the below. I ultimately want to use chatGPT or cursor to help manage my implementation plan , research, and documentation. My company operates out of linear, and I would like to plan there, but through the use of an MCP or ChatGPT connector. I have not tried this before.
Here are my highest priorities:

- Cost of Manufacturing and Offering *(refer to `/docs/raw/cost-of-manufacturing-offering-context.md` for the authoritative breakdown and live updates)*
- Update and clean up all the pricing proposals and contracts into a board-quality financial model.
- Economics and legal structure decision, based on cost, scalability, and viability of the investment platform to SMBs, my company, and retail investors
- Determine minimum check size
- Robust documentation in markdown & PRDs and documents in linear, cursor rules for prototyping calculations and agentic data schema and other workflows, ChatGPT project rules for research and agentic workflows for efficiency in linear and context management, tryshortcut.ai modeling rules and prompting templates
- Company financial model and monetization
- Comparable fee structures and platform valuations
- Comparable cost and vendor mapping across precedent companies and legal structures.
  Based on what I'm telling you below, propose a plan for how we can start working together. Propose multiple options and a recommendations that make it easy for me to combine or approve. If you have clarifying questions, that's ok. Ultimately I want to keep a running list of those as we will have a lot of clarification and decisions and context to work through. You are my partner and should be aiming to make it easy for me to move quickly and efficiently. I want to clarify context, work, decisions, and documentation for myself, future agents that onboard into my workflow, and my team. We are in planning mode, so do not go implementing solutions (you are missing a lot more context and requirements).
  Outlining a capital structure and the makeup of our investors and their gross-to-net returns.
  The general goals and assumptions:
- Total Capitalization Amount ($)
- Check Sizes ($10, $100, $250, $500, $1000, $5000, $10000, $25000, $50000, $100000
- Assume these are rows in the cap table.
- Check Size minimum (will be an input of one of the check size options). Any check size minimum below that we'll turn off
- Check Size maximum (will be 9.8% \* total capitalization). Instead of including in check size, we will just round down to the nearest check size, and turn off everything above.
  For each row in the cap table, I'm going to want to gauge initial demand. Gauge initial demand with a number of indications of interest. We have a column for indicated interest dollars, Interest cumulative dollars, Interest cumulative percent of dollars, indicated interest by check size percent of total. And indicated interest percent of cumulative total.
  We should have preset expectations across check sizes around sizing, assuming a $1 million property (total capitalization).
  If there is more indicated interest than total capitalization, we are going to want to create a pro rata mechanism down.
  If there's less indicated interest than total, we should have a shortfall row.
  There should be an assumption for each check size around dollar and percent gross cash yield. An assumption for each check size around net cash yield lost to expenses.
  There should be a dollar per investor per year net cash yield lost to expenses.
  A fair market value of the property at purchase, which will be Greater than or equal to total capitalization.
  There should be an input selection minimum check size and maximum check size. You should not be able to choose a maximum check size greater than the 9.8 test we've already established.
  There should be a total row across this entire cap table.
  There should be some type Around whether the investor is a repeat investor in other properties. Determine whether this is a percent across the entire structure. Likely, tt will differ from check size to check size.
  There will be multiple cap tables based off of multiple milestones in the deal ("stages"):
- Claimed-Pre Launch
- General Roadshow, where there is an input for cash yield. We will need to come back to the constraints around cash yield selection. It will be a range. There will be an input for property SF at this stage, but this doesn't need to be built into the cap table
- Specific Roadshow, where there is an input for cash yield. We will need to come back to the constraints around cash yield selection. It will be a range.
- Specific Offering, where there is an input for cash yield. We will need to come back to the constraints around cash yield selection. It will be a range.
- Committed offering
- Closed Offering
  Each stage of the deal will have different inputs and calculations. We will need to design a table on this, and should come back to it, but to start: CRE Price, Affordability, Gross Cash Yield, "Upside" (we will define this mechanism more thoroughly later.
  There will be indications of interest for Claimed Pre-Launch, General Roadshow, Specific Roadshow, Specific Offering.
  There will be committments for specific offering. Specific offering can be overcommitted (greater than capitalization), or less than (undercommitted). We will want to track indications of interest in this stage, as we should expect some percentage of those to convert into committments. We should have a percentage of these by check size.
  A committed offering will no longer have indications of interest, but will have committments, called committments (funded), called and unfunded committments, and [overcommitments].
  Before we have actual deals, we are going to need to be able to model across a lot of different scenarios, for different purposes as we build a robust, flexibile model to handle all future combinations and iterations, and as we stress-test our business model and economics, and define the key metrics we want to track (and "productize for the market"). NOTE we'll want a glossary of all the defined terms we use in these scenarios.
  We will want to be able to not only model at the deal level, but at the platform level across scale. We'll have assumptions for number of Investors and their conversion through a funnel (Lead, Account, Qualified Account, Funded Account, Committed Investor, Funded Investor, Closed Investor). Investors will be able to partcipate in more than one transaction, which will likely dictate the minimum check size the platform is willing and able to offer them, based on one-time costs, vs. recurring / variable costs as they move through the platform. The volume and conversion of investors will be important, as there are substantial costs to support the platform, and our small business and investor users on our technology and through the stages. We will need to create "the cost of manufacturing a deal", which will be a model that tracks our spend across vendors and assuming (interconnected) scale across both the SMB and Investor funnels. These costs will be borne by different stakeholders at different times, and it is important that we are able to track how they are incurred by the stakeholders from a cash perspective, how they are "amortized" over time through additional volume, and ultimately monetization via transactions, fees, cash yields, upside monetization. We will want to tie this to a company model that is very clean and easy to digest. We are extremely focused on each of these costs and how they scale, because we are focused on buying and capitalizing small transactions [1-10M]. When we think about monetization, there should be a minimum and maximum deal size that the platform will support, and a distribution of prices in that range that is defined and may change over time. We will want to map this to a TAM and expansion plan, where we unlock more of the market for commercial real estate types, geographies, and % traction.
  The transactions will be offered under Reg A+ (Tier II). We are contemplating multiple structures currently for each transaction, and need to compare the costs of manufacturing an offering across scale and fixed and variable costs over a timeline.
  We are finalizing our economic model and trying to make a decision shortly as to whether we will use an LLC or REIT model.
  First, we are contemplating an UPREIT structure in order to give withco and the SMB tenant participation in the upside of the property upon liquidation. We understand generally that the upside (e.g., profit interests) would need to be in an OP instead of the REIT. However, we want to keep the structure as simple as possible and so we don't necessarily need to build a 721 exchange feature into the documents right now. We also are trying to assess whether we can grant the SMB profit interests or whether we would need to give them a different type of security in the UPREIT, since profit interests are typically issued to management in exchange for services from our understanding. See below how we are thinking about the various classes of securities in the UPREIT.
  Retail Investor Interests: REIT common interests representing a targeted [8]% distribution that accrue if unpaid;
  Withco Interests: OP profit interests issued to withco representing 20% of the upside upon liquidation; and
  SMB Interests: OP [profit interests] issued to SMB representing up to [80]% of the upside upon liquidation, subject to certain incremental vesting over the life of the SMB's [10] year lease, and with retail investors participating in the unvested portion of the upside if the SMB defaults on the lease.
  This structure will require specific accounting compliance and costs to set up and maintain (specifically:
  REIT Testing (REIT)
  Tax Compliance (REIT & OP)
  1099-DIV (REIT) & K-1 Prep (OP)
  We need to be able to understand the costs of these ongoing tax items across economies of scale. Currently, we are leveling bid proposals across 1, 10, 100, 1k properties, each with 100, 1k, 10k Reg A investors in the REIT.
  It is not only important for us to understand our costs to prepare these tax forms for investors, but ultimately, the cost for them to file. Our upreit structure is expensive to set up and more complicated, but it gives the investors the benefit of having 1099-DIVs vs. K-1s. Both are similarly easy to prepare, but K-1s are much more expensive for retail investors to file.
  We are comparing the upreit structure to a single LLC model. In this model, the withco, SMB, and investor interests will all be in the same LLC. Retail investors will get K-1s.
  We need to compare the costs of these two options across: (i) upfront legal costs to set up; (ii) ongoing legal costs to replicate the structure for each new property; (iii) tax preparation and filing costs, REIT complicance costs. There are massive differences in these options, and it will impact the minimum check size, upfront investment, scalability of the platform, and gross to net yields for investors.
  Our first priority is getting this decision made, but it is relatively all encompassing. I'm going to need to understand our runway and liquidity to set up and scale across either options.
  We have signed contracts with third party platforms and data providers to help stand up and develop the SMB and investor experience, as well as develop internal tooling and analytics and process.
  North Capital: our main white-label provider for the Investment, funding, trade, issuance technology platform. We use their API and have a signed contract. We need to make decisions around what payment methods we'll support (ACH, Credit Card). These have different costs. North capital also does KYC/AML (IDology), Accredidation (not needed), Escrow, E-Sign Automation (Docusign). Many of these are through third party providers. We will need to model these costs, and ultimately will want to replace them with other providers that are more cost effective.
  Oscilar: the risk and underwriting orchestration platform. We have a signed contract with them, and are procuring third party data providers through their Platform as a Service. We are signing contracts with Enigma (KYB/Fimographic/Location API data), and Baselayer (KYB/Fraud/AML, etc.) to underwrite the small businesses that onboard onto our platform. We have cost proposals from both of these providers.
  Rutter: we underwrite SMB cash flows through their financial accounting and POS integrations. We have contracts with them.
  Extend: document parsing, no contract (free tier), but have an estimate. We use them to parse tax returns.
  Cherre: Commercial real estate data used in underwriting. We have a contract with them.
  Transfer Agent: we will need this, I have a budget
  Broker Dealer: we are not implementing this right away
  Property / Fund accounting: we will need this, and have some bids
  Reg A Audit annual audit costs / offering: I don't have a quote for this
  EDGAR filing service: I don't have a quote for this
  These are all costs we'll incur OUTSIDE of other traditional transaction costs related to the real estate.
  Appraisal: Have bids from CBRE and JLL for MSAs for restricted appraisals. Because of the Reg A, there are additional complications and costs associated with this.
  3P CRE Diligence: Property Condition Reports, Environmental (Phase I, Phase II), Zoning Reports, Survey
  CRE Legal Transaction Costs: the typical; we do not have counsel yet. We are going to want to launch the platform nationwide, and so our forms will need to scale. We enter into a new lease with each tenant. We haven't figured out who to work with on this form lease, or how we'll scale across local counsel to ensure we're protected.
  SMB Diligence Costs: we need to ensure we do credit checks and third-party diligence for our investors. We are unsecured landlords, but will want a robust, technology first asset management platform.
  Property Management: we do not have this in house
  Special Servicing: we do not have this in house
  Ongoing valuation and NAV calculations (ultimately to support a ATS system and the follow-on liquidity features I discussed).
  Bank Accounts and setup cost: we don't have this understood or priced yet
  Insurance MSAs and brokerage: we don't have this yet (passed through to the tenants under our NNN lease)
  Investor relations cost: we don't have this fully understood or priced yet
  Marketing budget: we don't have this yet

**Canonical cost-of-manufacturing reference**: Detailed, living documentation for cost-of-manufacturing analysis now lives in `/docs/raw/cost-of-manufacturing-offering-context.md`. Maintain vendor costs, structural comparisons, and decision logs there and summarize only key updates in this intake narrative.
0) How we’ll collaborate (options you can approve “as‑is” or mix & match)
Option A — “Lean model first” (fastest path to a board‑quality model)

Goal: Prioritize a single, auditable financial model + supporting PRDs/Markdown, then systematize connectors.

Deliverables:

Board‑quality economic model (Google Sheets or Excel) with Deal, Platform, and Scenario Manager tiers.

PRDs + glossary in Markdown for Linear.

A cost “BOM” (bill of materials) for “cost of manufacturing a deal.”

Use when: You want to decide UPREIT vs single LLC and min check size quickly.

Option B — “Systematize early” (schema + repo + connectors)

Goal: Define the canonical data model and automation scaffolding first so the model and docs are reproducible at scale.

Deliverables:

Canonical data schema (YAML + Markdown) for deals, investors, costs, and stages.

A Cursor repo with unit‑tested calculation modules and a simple CLI for scenarios (no prod deployment).

ChatGPT connectors/MCP design to push/pull issues & docs in Linear (custom MCP server for Linear’s GraphQL API; see references).

Use when: You want durable infra for iterative modeling with agents.

Option C — “Dual‑track” (docs + model in parallel)

Goal: Build the decision‑grade model while codifying PRDs, rules, and templates so you and the team (and future agents) can move in lock‑step.

Deliverables: Everything in A plus the schema and repo scaffolding from B, but staged.

My recommendation: Option C (Dual‑track). It lets us decide structure & minimums quickly and avoids rework.

1. Core artifacts we will produce (before any implementation)

Board‑quality Financial Model (auditable & scenario‑driven)

Tabs (deal tier):

Assumptions_Deal: property, capitalization, stage gates, yield ranges.

CheckSize_Ladder: the allowed check sizes, enable/disable flags, min/max logic (9.8% cap).

Demand_IOI: indications of interest by check size, cumulative math, shortfall/over‑subscription.

Allocator_ProRata: fair allocation using a largest‑remainder method with rounding to check buckets and max caps.

Expenses_Per_Investor: per‑investor annual dollar cost and % yield drag (structure‑dependent).

Gross_To_Net: gross yield → net cash yield by check size, after expense drag and fees.

Waterfall_Upside: structure‑dependent liquidation waterfall (retail REIT common, OP profit interests for withco/SMB with vesting/default rules).

Tabs (platform tier):

Investor_Funnel: lead → funded → repeat, with check‑size distribution by cohort.

Cost_BOM: “cost of manufacturing a deal,” vendor catalog, unit/step costs, scale curves.

P&L_Platform: fee stack, unit economics, runway, sensitivity to deal cadence & investor mix.

Scenario_Manager: toggle structure (UPREIT vs LLC), scale ladders (properties × investors), payment rails mix (ACH/CC), vendor swaps.

Controls: input validation, versioning, sensitivity toggles, and audit checks.

2. Cap table & demand model — structure and logic (matches your requirements)
   A. Inputs

Total Capitalization ($) — e.g., $1,000,000 for examples.

Check Sizes (enabled set): $10, $100, $250, $500, $1,000, $5,000, $10,000, $25,000, $50,000, $100,000.

Min Check Size (input): must be one of the allowed sizes; all smaller buckets disabled.

Max Check Size (computed cap): MaxCap = floor_to_nearest_checksize( 0.098 × TotalCap ).

Rule: disable any check sizes above MaxCap.

Stage (one of): Claimed–Pre‑Launch, General Roadshow, Specific Roadshow, Specific Offering, Committed Offering, Closed Offering.

Stage‑specific ranges: allowable Gross Cash Yield range (we’ll codify the constraints soon), CRE price, Affordability, Upside placeholder.

Assumptions per check size:

GrossCashYield\_%[i]

NetYieldLoss\_%[i] (platform/other %)

PerInvestorAnnualCost\_$[i] (KYC/escrow/TA/tax form/IR, etc.; structure‑dependent)

RepeatInvestor\_%[i]

Indications of Interest (IOI):

IOI_Count[i] and/or IOI_Dollars[i] (we’ll support both entry modes).

Commitment stage: Commit*Dollars[i] (with over/under‑commit handling), Called*$, Funded_$, Unfunded\_$.

B. Derived columns per check‑size row

Enabled[i] (based on min/max rules)

Indicated\_$[i] (from IOI_Count×CheckSize or direct entry)

Cumulative*$, Cumulative*%

%OfTotal*By_Bucket = Indicated*$[i] / TotalCap

%OfCumulative*By_Bucket = Indicated*$[i] / SUM(Indicated_$[<=i])

GrossYield*$ = GrossCashYield*%[i] × Allocated\_$[i]

ExpenseDrag*$ = NetYieldLoss*%[i] × Allocated*$[i] + PerInvestorAnnualCost*$[i] × InvestorCount[i]

NetYield*%[i] = GrossCashYield*%[i] − NetYieldLoss*%[i] − (PerInvestorAnnualCost*$[i] / CheckSize[i])

RepeatInvestorCount[i] = InvestorCount[i] × RepeatInvestor\_%[i]

C. Allocation logic

If TotalIOI*$ ≤ TotalCap → No pro‑rata; Shortfall = TotalCap − TotalIOI*$.

If TotalIOI\_$ > TotalCap → Pro‑rata down using a largest‑remainder (Hamilton) method with check‑size rounding and max caps:

Compute alpha = TotalCap / TotalIOI\_$.

For each bucket, base allocation units = floor( (IOI\_$[i] × alpha) / CheckSize[i] ).

Compute remainders; distribute remaining units 1‑by‑1 to buckets with highest remainders, respecting:

Enabled buckets only.

Per‑investor cap of MaxCap (i.e., any single commitment can’t exceed MaxCap; in bucketed mode this typically maps to #units per investor).

Convert units back to dollars by bucket; any residual cents go to the smallest bucket.

D. Totals

A bottom “Total” row for indicated, allocated, shortfall/overage, gross and net cash yields, expense drag, and investor counts.

E. Structure hooks

UPREIT: Retail investors modeled as REIT Common with a target distribution (e.g., 8%) that accrues if unpaid; OP profit interests for withco and the SMB, with a vesting schedule and default rules shifting unvested portions back to investors.

Single LLC: All investors (retail/withco/SMB) in one LLC; distribution policy configurable; K‑1 issuance per investor.

3. Deal stages & data we track (scaffolding now; constraints later)
   (We’ll keep the waterfall module abstract but pluggable so we can evaluate both structures consistently.)

| Stage                  | Data Inputs (examples)                           | Key Metrics                              | What Changes vs Prior Stage          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Claimed–Pre‑Launch** | Early IOIs by check bucket; property class & MSA | Warm interest depth; bucket mix          | No commitments; yield is placeholder |
| **General Roadshow**   | Gross yield **range**; MSA & size; TAM messaging | IOI conversion %, channel attribution    | Yield constraint introduced (range)  |
| **Specific Roadshow**  | Named property; tighter yield range; draft terms | IOI→Soft commit rate by bucket           | Apply max check enforcement          |
| **Specific Offering**  | Final terms; subscription docs                   | Over/under‑subscription; pro‑rata factor | Move from IOI to **Commit**          |
| **Committed Offering** | Called vs uncalled; funded vs unfunded           | Funded %, fallout rates                  | No new IOIs; enforce call schedule   |
| **Closed Offering**    | Final cap table; NAV policy cadence              | Net yield realized; fees actuals         | Lock and start reporting             |

We’ll maintain IOI at the first four stages and Commitments/Calls/Funding from Specific Offering onward.

4. “Cost of manufacturing a deal” — the BOM that ties everything together

Each cost line is a “Cost Card” with:

Vendor (North Capital, Oscilar, Enigma, Baselayer, Rutter, Extend, Cherre, Appraisal vendors, Transfer Agent, EDGAR service, Auditor, CRE counsel, Property Mgmt, Special Servicer, …)

Service (e.g., KYC/AML per investor, ACH transfer, DocuSign envelope, escrow setup, Reg A audit annual, REIT testing, 1099‑DIV prep, K‑1 prep, appraisal, PCR, Phase I/II, survey, zoning, NAV calc, IR ticket, distribution payment, etc.)

Unit basis: per investor, per property, per transaction, per envelope, per ACH, per year, per call to data API, per MSA, per filing, etc.

Price schedule: unit price, minimums/commitments, step‑function tiers, overage rates, setup fees.

Payer (Company, REIT/LLC, Investor, SMB) and Timing (pre‑close, at close, ongoing).

Accounting (expensed vs capitalized; amortization period if capitalized in offering costs).

Scalability NOTE (what unlocks better pricing: properties, investors, AUM, MSAs?).

Replacement candidates & switching costs.

This BOM feeds both the deal net yields (per‑investor and % drags) and the platform P&L.

5. Minimum check size methodology (ties to your per‑investor costs)

Let:

C_inv = total annual per‑investor cost (KYC/escrow/TA/tax form/IR, etc.) under a chosen structure.

y_g = investor gross cash yield (%) on invested dollars.

y_drag% = % yield lost to platform/structure expenses (ex‑C_inv).

Target net yield constraint: y_net ≥ y_min (e.g., avoid negative or sub‑X bps outcomes).

Then a conservative threshold is:

MinCheck ≈ C_inv / max( y_g − y_drag% − y_min , ε )

We’ll compute this by bucket and at platform averages, under both structures, and show sensitivity to C_inv and payment rails mix (ACH vs credit card). This is often the most decisive driver between 1099‑DIV (REIT) vs K‑1 (LLC) at small checks.

6. Structure compare: UPREIT vs Single LLC (modeling framework)

Up‑front (per property or program):

Formation & structuring (REIT + OP, profit‑interest plan & vesting schedules, trust/custodial where relevant).

Offering docs (Reg A+ Tier II), audit baseline, EDGAR setup, TA onboarding.

Recurring:

Compliance: REIT testing (asset/income/shareholder/distribution), OP accounting.

Tax: 1099‑DIV (REIT) vs K‑1 (LLC) issuance & investor support (and investor filing burden proxy, for net‑of‑filing‑cost analyses).

Reporting: NAV cadence, audit/quarterly/semiannual reporting (Tier II), transfer agent, escrow, KYC ongoing.

Operational: Appraisals/valuations, property accounting, PM/servicing, insurance, IR.

Model knobs (we’ll normalize every quote/proposal into these):

Setup*$, Annual_Base*$, Per_Investor_$, Per*Property*$, Per_Transaction_$, Per*API_Call*$, Step*Tier*{threshold,unit_price}, and learning curves (discounts at 10/100/1k properties; 100/1k/10k investors).

Waterfall differences we’ll capture:

UPREIT: REIT common (target distribution, accrual rules) + OP profit interests → withco 20% upside; SMB up to 80% with incremental vesting across a 10‑year lease; unvested reallocates to retail upon SMB default (exact rules configurable).

LLC: single waterfall, member classes for retail/withco/SMB; vesting gates and default logic applied directly in LLC.

We’ll present apples‑to‑apples investor net cash yields, gross‑to‑net loss by cause, and platform margin under both structures at multiple scales (1, 10, 100, 1k properties × 100, 1k, 10k investors).

7. Platform monetization & comps (research plan, not implementation)

Revenue levers to model: acquisition fees, AUM/asset‑servicing fees, distribution/TA pass‑throughs (yes/no), secondary/ATS fees later, data/analytics services, SMB programmatic fees, premium features for repeat investors.

Comparable mapping (to research): fractional RE/SFR (e.g., Arrived), mixed‑asset platforms, REIT FinTech hybrids, traditional sponsors using Reg A.

Valuation anchors: take‑rate × throughput, fee‑bearing AUM, CAC & LTV by cohort, net revenue per investor and per property.

Output: comp tables and fee ladders to inform minimum viable fee stack and price‑to‑scale glidepath.

(We’ll treat this as a focused research sprint once the core model is in place.)

8. Decision & risks register (living log we’ll create in Linear)

Structure choice: UPREIT vs single LLC — decision owner & target date.

Min check size: by structure and stage; policy for repeat‑investor minimums.

Payment rails: ACH only at launch vs ACH+Card; who bears card fees and how capped.

Transfer agent & EDGAR provider: shortlist and selection criteria.

Audit cadence & vendor: baseline quotes and escalation at scale.

Appraisal/3P diligence strategy: MSA coverage, “restricted appraisal” policy under Reg A.

CRE counsel strategy: national forms + local counsel playbook.

NAV policy: frequency and method; tolerance bands.

IR & Marketing budget: baseline and scale curve.

Vendor replacement roadmap: where North Capital (or others) may be swapped for cost savings.

Choose an engagement option (A/B/C) or tell me how you want to combine them.

Prioritize the first decisions you want the model to answer (e.g., structure choice and minimum check size).

Point me to the scattered inputs (at a high level only for now):

Which files are canonical (Sheets/Excel), which are scratch?

Which vendor quotes are final vs ballpark (North Capital, Oscilar/Enigma/Baselayer, Rutter, Cherre, appraisal, TA, auditor, EDGAR, CRE counsel, PM/servicer)?

Your current beliefs (acceptable investor net yield floor; what you want min check to be; early view on REIT vs LLC).

Stage constraints you already have in mind for gross cash yield ranges at Roadshow/Offering.

12. Clarifying questions & assumptions (running list to track in Linear)

Capital structure:

For the UPREIT: confirm whether REIT common distributions can accrue and the conditions under which accruals are paid; confirm OP interest vesting schedule for SMB (milestones along the 10‑year lease) and exact default reallocation rule.

Are withco’s 20% and SMB’s up‑to‑80% mutually exclusive caps or overlapping that sum to a hard cap?

Tax & investor communications: Any target limit for number of tax forms per investor per year? Any preference to pass certain costs to investors (vs absorb at platform)?

Investor experience: Do you intend to gate small checks to repeat investors only after N deals?

Payment rails: Tolerance for credit‑card costs in early traction; do we surcharge, cap, or disable?

Transfer agent & EDGAR: any preferred vendors or constraints?

Valuation cadence & NAV policy: monthly vs quarterly?

IR SLAs: target response times that imply support headcount (for the per‑investor annual cost).

Deal cadence goal for Year 1: coarse target to anchor scale assumptions.

Data access: Which systems (Linear, Notion, GDrive, email) hold the final versions of contracts/quotes?

13. Immediate next steps (planning only)

Approve Option C (or adjust) and confirm your top two decisions to answer first.

I’ll convert this plan into:

A PRD outline and Glossary (Markdown),

A model spec detailing every tab, input, and check, and

A connector/MCP design doc (high level) so you can bless scope.

We’ll schedule a short working session to lock the structure comparison inputs and min‑check policy guardrails.
